Tanaproget is a nonsteroidal progestin agonist with very high PR binding affinity and excellent in vivo potency. When appropriately radiolabeled, it might be used to image PR-positive breast tumors noninvasively by positron emission tomography (PET). We describe the synthesis and PR binding affinities of a series of fluoroalkyl-substituted 6-aryl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxazine-2-thiones, analogues of Tanaproget. Some of these compounds have subnanomolar binding affinities, higher than that of either Tanaproget itself or the high affinity PR ligand R5020. Structure-binding affinity relationships can be rationalized by molecular modeling of ligand complexes with PR, and the enantioselectivity of binding has been predicted. These compounds are being further evaluated as potential diagnostic PET imaging agents for breast cancer, and enantiomerically pure materials of defined stereochemistry are being prepared., ",,C[C@]1(O)CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4=C3C=C[C@@]21C,C19H24O2,CHEMBL166444,0.52,0.56,0.6,0.61,0.68,0.74,0.99,1.21,1.51,1.95

Inducing degradation of a target protein presents several advantages relative to simple inhibition including a potential for extended duration of action and more profound pharmacology. While engineered heterodimeric molecules have recently been a major focus within industry and academia, this Perspective highlights examples of targeted protein degradation observed for smaller, monomeric molecules. Methods and tools for evaluating protein degradation as well as a discussion of physical properties of monomeric vs engineered heterodimeric degraders are presented.",,C[C@](O)(Cn1ccc2cc(F)ccc21)C(=O)Nc1ccc(C#N)c(C(F)(F)F)c1,C20H15F4N3O2,CHEMBL4444904,1300.0,,,,,,,,,
