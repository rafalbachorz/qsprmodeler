High-throughput screening is often plagued by low hit rates and many leads that are toxic or exhibit poor bioavailability. Exploiting the secondary activity of marketed drugs, on the other hand, may help in generating drug leads that can be optimized for the observed side-effect target, while maintaining acceptable bioavailability and toxicity profiles. Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico ""drug repurposing"" procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives acetophenazine, fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics.",,O=C(CN1c2ccccc2Sc2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc21)c1cccc2ccccc12,C25H16F3NOS,CHEMBL263660,76.0,,

Preclinical data suggest that antagonists of this nuclear receptor may enhance the activity of anticancer therapy. The first-generation GR antagonist mifepristone is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in various oncology settings. Structure-based modification of mifepristone led to the discovery of ORIC-101 (28), a highly potent steroidal GR antagonist with reduced androgen receptor (AR) agonistic activity amenable for dosing in androgen receptor positive tumors and with improved CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 inhibition profile to minimize drug-drug interaction potential. Unlike mifepristone, 28 could be codosed with chemotherapeutic agents readily metabolized by CYP2C8 such as paclitaxel. Furthermore, 28 demonstrated in vivo antitumor activity by enhancing response to chemotherapy in the GR+ OVCAR5 ovarian cancer xenograft model. Clinical evaluation of safety and therapeutic potential of 28 is underway., Entry 1: Structure-based modification of mifepristone (1) led to the discovery of novel mifepristone derivatives with improved selectivity profile. Addition of a methyl group at the C10 position of the steroid has a significant impact on progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) activity. Within this series, OP-3633 (15) emerged as a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist with increased selectivity against PR and AR, improved cytochrome P450 inhibition profile, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to 1. Furthermore, 15 demonstrated substantial inhibition of GR transcriptional activity in the GR positive HCC1806 triple negative breast cancer xenograft model.

Addition of a methyl group at the C10 position of the steroid has a significant impact on progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) activity. Within this series, OP-3633 (15) emerged as a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist with increased selectivity against PR and AR, improved cytochrome P450 inhibition profile, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to 1.
