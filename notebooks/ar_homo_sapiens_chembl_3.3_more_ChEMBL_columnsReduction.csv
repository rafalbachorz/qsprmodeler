Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies indicated that the bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) moieties, the conjugated beta-diketone moiety, and the intramolecular symmetry of the molecules seem to be important factors related to antiandrogenic activity. The data further suggest that the coplanarity of the beta-diketone moiety and the presence of a strong hydrogen bond donor group were also crucial for the antiandrogenic activity, which is consistent with previous SAR results for hydroxyflutamide analogues. When the pharmacophoric elements of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and compound 4 are superposed, the resulting construct implies that the curcumin analogues may function as a 17alpha-substituted DHT.
