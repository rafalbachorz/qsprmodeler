Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide). Notably, 6a maintains its antiandrogenic activity with AR mutants W741L and T877A commonly observed and activated by bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, in prostate cancer patients., Entry 3: We report herein a stereoselective and straightforward methodology for the synthesis of new androgen receptor ligands with (anti)-agonistic activities.

Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms. Most of these drugs show limited application due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1).

A series of 1-(2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazole analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their suitability for consideration as clinical candidates. 1-((S)-2-Aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol (9) was identified as a peripherally acting potent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (EC(50) = 42.7 nM, E(max) = 89%) with high selectivity for the 5-HT(2) receptors relative to other serotonergic receptor subtypes and other families of receptors and has significantly greater solution stability than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect.

Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide). Notably, 6a maintains its antiandrogenic activity with AR mutants W741L and T877A commonly observed and activated by bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, in prostate cancer patients., Entry 1: To circumvent antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer, antiandrogens effective for both the androgen receptor (AR) and AR mutants are required. The AR antagonists in this study originate from previous findings, which showed that subtle differences in substitution pattern lead to a conformational change that alters the ligand activity, rendering an agonist to an antagonist. We have identified small yet potent tropanol-based ligands possessing significant antiandrogenic activity with both wild-type AR and the two most common AR ligand binding domain (LBD) mutants., ",,C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@@H](CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@@]43C)[C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2O,C19H28O2,CHEMBL386630,0.1,100.0,,,,,,

We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome.

Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity.

Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms. Most of these drugs show limited application due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1). Selected hits demonstrated full AR antagonistic behaviour and promising candidates for further development were identified., Entry 1: A novel scaffold of indoline thiohydantoin was discovered as potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist through rational drug designation. Several compounds showed good biological profiles in AR binding and higher selective toxicity than enzalutamide toward LNCaP cells (AR-rich) versus DU145 cells (AR-deficient). In addition, the docking studies supported the rationalization of the biological evaluation. Among these compounds, the representative compound 48c exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on LNCaP growth and also acted as a competitive AR antagonist. Further preliminary mechanism study confirmed that 48c exerted its AR antagonistic activity through impairing AR nuclear translocation. All these results indicated that the novel scaffold compounds demonstrated AR antagonistic behavior and promising candidates for future development were identified., Entry 2: Prostate cancer (PC) is a major cause of cancer-related male death in worldwide and the identification of new and improved potent anti-PC molecules is constantly required. A novel scaffold of tetrahydroisoquinoline thiohydantoin was rationally designed based on the enzalutamide structures and our pre-work, leading to the discovery of a series of new antiproliferative compounds. Several new analogues displayed improved androgen receptor (AR) antagonistic activity, while maintaining the higher selective toxicity toward LNCaP cells (AR-rich) versus DU145 cells (AR-deficient) compared to enzalutamide. In fact, compound 55 exhibited promising in vitro antitumor activity by impairing AR unclear translocation. More importantly, 55 showed better pharmacokinetic properties compared to the compound 1 reported in our pre-work. These results demonstrate a step towards the development of novel and improved AR antagonists., Entry 3: A novel scaffold of arylpiperazine derivatives was discovered as potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist through rational drug designation based on our pre-work, leading to the discovery of a series of new antiproliferative compounds. Compounds 10, 16, 27, 29 and 31 exhibited relatively strong antagonistic potency against AR and exhibited potent AR binding affinities, while compounds 5, 6, 10, 14, 16, 19, 21, 27 and 31 exhibited strong cytotoxic activities against LNCaP cells (AR-rich) as well as also displayed the higher activities than finasteride toward PC-3 (AR-deficient) and DU145 (AR-deficient). Docking study suggested that the most potent antagonist 16 mainly bind to AR ligand binding pocket (LBP) site through hydrogen bonding interactions. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these designed arylpiperazine derivatives was rationally explored and discussed. These results indicated that the novel scaffold compounds demonstrated a step towards the development of novel and improved AR antagonists, and promising candidates for future development were identified., Entry 4: Prostate cancer is one of the main causes of male cancer-related deaths worldwide and the suppression of androgen receptor signalling is established as an effective strategy for the treatment. A series of galeterone analogues including several steroid-fused azacycles, as well as 17-(benzimidazol-1-ylimino), 16α-(benzimidazol-2-ylamino), and 16α-(benzothiazol-2-ylamino) steroid derivatives, were synthesized and tested against prostate cancer cell lines. Candidate compound 3f was shown to reduce AR-regulated transcription in a dose-dependent manner in nanomolar ranges and suppress expression of AR-regulated proteins Nkx3.1 and PSA in 22Rv1-ARE14 and VCaP cancer cell lines. Flexible docking study revealed similar position of 3f within AR binding site in comparison of galeterone even with stronger binding energy., Entry 5: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major cause of cancer-related male death in worldwide. To develop of potential anti-prostate cancer agents, 22 kinds of 4-Amino-2H-benzo[h]chromen-2-one analogs were designed and synthesized as potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist through rational drug modification leading to the discovery of a series of novel antiproliferative compounds. Analogs (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 21, 23, and 24) exhibited potent antagonistic potency against AR (inhibition >50%), and exhibited potent AR binding affinities as well as displayed the higher activities than finasteride toward LNCaP cells (AR-rich) versus PC-3 cells (AR-deficient). Moreover, the docking study suggested that the most potent antagonist 23 mainly bind to AR ligand binding pocket (LBP) site through Van der Waals' force interactions. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these designed 4-Amino-2H-benzo[h]chromen-2-one analogs was rationally explored and discussed. Collectively, this work provides a potential lead compound for anticancer agent development related to prostate cancer therapy, and took a step forward towards the development of novel and improved AR antagonists., Entry 6: Prostate cancer (PC) is the most diagnosed type of malignancy in men and the major frequently cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The androgen receptor (AR) has become a promising drug target for the treatment of PC. Here, we reported the design, optimization and evaluation of pyridine tetrahydroisoquinoline thiohydantoin derivatives with improved activity and safety as potent AR antagonists. The most promising compound 42f exhibited potent inhibitory activity on AR and strongly blocked AR nuclear translocation. Moreover, 42f displayed promising in vitro antitumor activity toward AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP) and also demonstrated therapeutic effects in LNCaP xenograft tumor model in mice (TGI: 79%) with no apparent toxicity observed in vivo. More importantly, 42f showed negligible penetration of the brain-blood barrier (BBB) compared with enzalutamide. These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of androgen receptor antagonists for potential therapeutics against PC with lower seizurogenic risk for patients., Entry 7: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies affecting men worldwide. Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model. These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of AR antagonists., ",,CNC(=O)c1ccc(N2C(=S)N(c3ccc(C#N)c(C(F)(F)F)c3)C(=O)C2(C)C)cc1F,C21H16F4N4O2S,CHEMBL1082407,20.0,84.7,84.7,84.7,85.5,86.5,86.5,95.0

Use of the propargyl ether 44 and Click chemistry showed that niphatenone B binds covalently to the activation function-1 (AF1) region of the AR N-terminus domain (NTD).",,CCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)/C=C/CCCOC[C@@H](O)CO,C21H40O4,CHEMBL1946012,50.0,,,,,,,

Using structure activity analysis, we established that the benzimidazole moiety at C-17 is essential and optimal and also that hydrophilic and heteroaromatic groups at C-3 enhance both antiproliferative (AP) and AR degrading (ARD) activities. The most potent antiproliferative compounds were 3β-(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (47), 3-((EZ)-hydroximino)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-4,16-diene (36), and 3β-(pyridine-4-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (43), with GI50 values of 0.87, 1.91, and 2.57 μM, respectively. Compared to 5, compound 47 was 4- and 8-fold more potent with respect to AP and ARD activities, respectively. Importantly, we also discovered that our compounds, including 5, 36, 43, and 47, could degrade both full-length and truncated ARs in CWR22rv1 human prostate cancer cells. With these activities, they have potential for development as new drugs for the treatment of all forms of prostate cancer., Entry 1: Prostate cancer is one of the main causes of male cancer-related deaths worldwide and the suppression of androgen receptor signalling is established as an effective strategy for the treatment. A series of galeterone analogues including several steroid-fused azacycles, as well as 17-(benzimidazol-1-ylimino), 16α-(benzimidazol-2-ylamino), and 16α-(benzothiazol-2-ylamino) steroid derivatives, were synthesized and tested against prostate cancer cell lines. Candidate compound 3f was shown to reduce AR-regulated transcription in a dose-dependent manner in nanomolar ranges and suppress expression of AR-regulated proteins Nkx3.1 and PSA in 22Rv1-ARE14 and VCaP cancer cell lines.

Starting from 2-benzyl-imidazoline screening hits, a series of structurally related 2-benzyl- and 4-benzyl-imidazoles was investigated first, but it proved highly challenging to obtain compounds having sufficient selectivity against the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor. This issue could be successfully addressed by modification of the linker region and SAR exploration led to the discovery of highly selective isopropyl-substituted 4-aminomethyl-imidazole compounds. The work culminated in the identification of the selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5073012 (4-chlorophenyl)-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-isopropyl-amine, 24), which has a good pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration in rodents. RO5073012 has been found to be active in a behavioural rat model which is considered indicative for schizophrenia.",,CCc1cccc(CC)c1Cc1ncc[nH]1,C14H18N2,CHEMBL2206397,2.0,,,,,,,

The structure-activity relationship analysis and structural optimization of C18 resulted in the discovery of a structural analogue (AT2), a more potent AR antagonist with 16-fold improved anti-AR potency.

Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model. These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of AR antagonists.",,CCS(=O)(=O)Nc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3c(O)cc(OC)c(OC(C)C)c3o2)cc1,C21H23NO7S,CHEMBL4878372,73.2,,,,,,,
