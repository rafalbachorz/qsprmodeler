Several analogues were able to activate hAR-mediated gene transcription more potently and efficaciously than dihydrotestosterone., ",,CCC1CC(CC)c2cc3c(C(F)(F)F)cc(=O)oc3cc2N1,C17H18F3NO2,CHEMBL6721,7.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.5,7.0,8.5,8.5,10.0,0.929418926,0.929418926,0.84509804,8.070581074,8.070581074,8.15490196,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,8.5,8.5,7.0,10.0,8.070581074285707,8.070581074285707,8.154901959985743,8.0,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases., Entry 2: A series of nonsteroidal human androgen receptor (hAR) antagonists based on 8-substituted 1,2-dihydro- and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2-dimethyl-6-trifluoromethylpyrido[3,2-g]quin olines was synthesized. Compounds in this series were tested for the ability to bind to hAR and inhibit hAR-dependent transcription in a mammalian cellular background., Entry 3: The electronic properties and relatively small size of fluorine endow it with considerable versatility as a bioisostere and it has found application as a substitute for lone pairs of electrons, the hydrogen atom, and the methyl group while also acting as a functional mimetic of the carbonyl, carbinol, and nitrile moieties. In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis. In this Perspective, applications of fluorine in the construction of bioisosteric elements designed to enhance the in vitro and in vivo properties of a molecule are summarized., ",,CC1(C)CCc2cc3c(C(F)(F)F)cc(O)nc3cc2N1,C15H15F3N2O,CHEMBL6874,27.0,27.0,27.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,27.0,27.0,27.0,27.0,1.431363764,1.431363764,1.431363764,7.568636236,7.568636236,7.568636236,4,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,27.0,27.0,27.0,27.0,7.568636235841013,7.568636235841013,7.568636235841013,7.568636235841013,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

discovered using cell-based cotransfection assays with human androgen receptor (hAR). This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases., Entry 1: A series of nonsteroidal human androgen receptor (hAR) antagonists based on 8-substituted 1,2-dihydro- and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2-dimethyl-6-trifluoromethylpyrido[3,2-g]quin olines was synthesized. Compounds in this series were tested for the ability to bind to hAR and inhibit hAR-dependent transcription in a mammalian cellular background., Entry 2: A novel series of isoindoledione based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR). Co-crystallization of members of this family of inhibitors was successfully accomplished with the T877A AR LBD. A working model of how this class of compounds functions to antagonize the AR was created. Based on this model, it was proposed that expanding the bicyclic portion of the molecule should result in analogs which function as effective antagonists against a variety of AR isoforms. In contrast to what was predicted by the model, SAR around this new series was dictated by the aniline portion rather than the bicyclic portion of the molecule., Entry 3: A novel series of isoindoledione based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR). SAR around this series revealed dramatic differences in binding and function in mutant variants (MT) of the AR as compared to the wild type (WT) receptor. Optimization of the aniline portion revealed substitution patterns, which yielded potent antagonist activity against the WT AR as well as the MT AR found in the LNCaP and PCa2b human prostate tumor cell lines., Entry 4: A series of 7alpha-substituted dihydrotestosterone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for androgen receptor (AR) pure antagonistic activity. From reporter gene assay (RGA), the compound with a side chain containing N-n-butyl-N-methyl amide (19a) showed pure antagonistic activity (IC(50)=340nM, FI(5)>10,000nM), whereas known AR antagonists showed partial agonistic activities. The optimization of 19a led to compound 23 (CH4892280), which showed more potent pure antagonistic activity (IC(50)=190nM, FI(5)>10,000nM). The SARs of tested compounds suggested that the length of the side chain and the substituents on the amide nitrogen are important for pure antagonistic activities., Entry 5: A series of 7alpha-substituted dihydrotestosterone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for androgen receptor (AR) pure antagonistic activity. From reporter gene assay (RGA), the compound with a side chain containing N-n-butyl-N-methyl amide (19a) showed pure antagonistic activity (IC(50)=340nM, FI(5)>10,000nM), whereas known AR antagonists showed partial agonistic activities. The optimization of 19a led to compound 23 (CH4892280), which showed more potent pure antagonistic activity (IC(50)=190nM, FI(5)>10,000nM). The SARs of tested compounds suggested that the length of the side chain and the substituents on the amide nitrogen are important for pure antagonistic activities., Entry 6: Lead optimization of CH4892280 (4), an androgen receptor (AR) pure antagonist, was investigated. Compounds 6 and 7, which have a carboxylic acid at the end of the side chain at the position 7alpha of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), showed partial agonistic activities in reporter gene assay (RGA). Conversion of the steroidal core structure to 17alpha-methyltestosterone gave compound 14, which showed weak pure antagonistic activity. Optimization of the side chain by the insertion of a phenyl ring led to compounds 22 and 28-30, which showed pure antagonistic activities at submicromolar concentrations. The structure-activity relationships were clarified., Entry 7: Lead optimization of CH4892280 (4), an androgen receptor (AR) pure antagonist, was investigated. Compounds 6 and 7, which have a carboxylic acid at the end of the side chain at the position 7alpha of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), showed partial agonistic activities in reporter gene assay (RGA). Conversion of the steroidal core structure to 17alpha-methyltestosterone gave compound 14, which showed weak pure antagonistic activity. Optimization of the side chain by the insertion of a phenyl ring led to compounds 22 and 28-30, which showed pure antagonistic activities at submicromolar concentrations. The structure-activity relationships were clarified., Entry 8: A novel series of [2.2.1]-oxabicyclo imide-based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor. Molecular modeling and iterative drug design were applied to optimize this series. The lead compound [3aS-(3aalpha,4beta,5beta,7beta,7aalpha)]-4-(octahydro-5-hydroxy-4,7-dimethyl-1,3-dioxo-4,7-epoxy-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-2-iodobenzonitrile was shown to have potent in vivo efficacy after oral dosing in the CWR22 human prostate tumor xenograph model., Entry 9: Various 4-(anilino)pyrrole-2-carboxamides were designed and synthesized as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists without steroidal or anilide structure, based on our strategy for developing full antagonists of nuclear receptors. Introduction of a bulky N-alkyl group, such as a cyclohexylmethyl or benzyl group, increased the binding affinity for wild-type AR and the potency for growth inhibition of androgen-dependent SC-3 cells. Among the compounds obtained, N-[4-[(benzyl)(4-nitrophenyl)amino]-1-methylpyrrole-2-carbonyl]pyrrolidine (22) is as potent an AR antagonist as the typical anilide-type AR antagonists hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. Further, compound 22 had potent binding affinity for T877A mutated AR, and dose-dependently inhibited the testosterone-induced production of prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP cells bearing T877A AR., Entry 10: We previously developed carborane-containing potent AR antagonists, BA321 and BA341, on the basis of our hypothesis that the carborane cage would be an excellent hydrophobic pharmacophore in place of steroidal C and D rings. As an extension of that work, we designed and synthesized carborane-containing AR antagonist candidates with a pyridine ring. Compound 6b, which has a pyridine ring directly bound to the p-carborane cage at the 3-position, exhibited potent AR-antagonistic activity in transcriptional activation assay using NIH3T3 cells transfected with a hAR-expression plasmid. In addition, it showed more potent antiandrogenic activity than that of the well-known antiandrogen flutamide and comparable activity to that of (R)-bicalutamide in SC-3 cell proliferation assay., Entry 11: Four new indolosesquiterpenes, lecanindoles A-D (1-4), were isolated from fermentations of the terrestrial fungus Verticillium lecanii 6144. The structures of compounds 1-4 were elucidated from analysis of spectroscopic data. Compound 2 was reduced to give 4 and its isomer 5. Compound 4 was found to be a potent and selective progesterone receptor agonist with an EC50 of 1.1 +/- 0.4 nM in a cell-based luciferase reporter assay., Entry 12: We report here the design, preparation, and systematic evaluation of a novel cycloalkane[d]isoxazole pharmacophoric fragment-containing androgen receptor (AR) modulators. Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide). Notably, 6a maintains its antiandrogenic activity with AR mutants W741L and T877A commonly observed and activated by bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, in prostate cancer patients., Entry 13: We previously reported that bis-phenol derivatives, including LG190178 (3a), possess not only vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonistic activity, but also androgen receptor (AR) antagonistic activity. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of silicon-containing bis-phenol derivatives, with the objective of obtaining increased selectivity toward VDR or AR. We found that replacement of the quaternary carbon in the bis-phenol skeleton with silicon increased AR-antagonistic activity and reduced VDR-agonistic activity, that is, the AR selectivity of the silicon-containing compounds was higher than that of corresponding carbon compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear receptor (NR) selectivity switching by sila-substitution (C/Si exchange). Among the compounds synthesized, AR-selective ligand (S,R)-3b exhibited more potent anti-androgenic activity (IC50=0.072 μM) than hydroxyflutamide, a well-known androgen antagonist (IC50=1.4 μM), in SC-3 cell proliferation assay. These results suggest that sila-substitution is a useful approach for structural development of selective AR ligands., Entry 14: We report the design and synthesis of novel 4-(4-benzoylaminophenoxy)phenol derivatives that bind to the androgen receptor (AR) ligand-binding domain and exhibit potent androgen-antagonistic activity. Compound 22 is one of the most potent of these derivatives, inhibiting the dihydrotestosterone-promoted growth of SC-3 cell line bearing wild-type AR (IC50 0.75 μM), LNCaP cell line bearing T877A-mutated AR (IC50 0.043 μM), and 22Rv1 cell line bearing H874Y-mutated AR (IC50 0.22 μM). Structure-activity relationship studies confirmed that the pharmacophore of these novel AR antagonists is distinct from the nitro- or cyano-substituted anilide substructure of other nonsteroidal AR antagonists. This novel pharmacophore is expected to provide a basis for designing new antiprostate cancer agents., Entry 15: The androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in multiple physiological functions, including differentiation, growth, and maintenance of male reproductive organs, and also has effects on hair and skin. In this paper, we report the synthesis of nonsteroidal AR antagonists having a 4-benzyl-1-(2H)-phthalazinone skeleton. Among the synthesized compounds, 11c with two ortho-substituents on the phenyl group potently inhibited SC-3 cell proliferation (IC50: 0.18 μM) and showed high wt AR-binding affinity (IC50: 10.9 μM), comparable to that of hydroxyflutamide (3). Compound 11c also inhibited proliferation of LNCaP cells containing T877A-mutated AR. Docking study of 11c with the AR ligand-binding domain indicated that the benzyl group is important for the antagonism. These phthalazinone derivatives may be useful for investigating potential clinical applications of AR antagonists., Entry 16: The androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in multiple physiological functions, including differentiation, growth, and maintenance of male reproductive organs, and also has effects on hair and skin.

These phthalazinone derivatives may be useful for investigating potential clinical applications of AR antagonists., Entry 17: Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C3 catalyzes the synthesis of active androgens that promote the progression of prostate cancer. AKR1C3 also contributes to androgen-independent cell proliferation and survival through the metabolism of prostaglandins and reactive aldehydes. Because of its elevation in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissues, AKR1C3 is a promising therapeutic target for CRPC. In this study, we found a novel potent AKR1C3 inhibitor, <i>N</i>-(4-fluorophenyl)-8-hydroxy-2-imino-2<i>H</i>-chromene-3-carboxamide (<b>2d</b>), and synthesized its derivatives with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 25-56 nM and >220-fold selectivity over other AKRs (1C1, 1C2, and 1C4). The structural factors for the inhibitory potency were elucidated by crystallographic study of AKR1C3 complexes with <b>2j</b> and <b>2l</b>. The inhibitors suppressed proliferation of prostate cancer 22Rv1 and PC3 cells through both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms. Additionally, <b>2j</b> and <b>2l</b> prevented prostate tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, the inhibitors significantly augmented apoptotic cell death induced by anti-CRPC drugs (abiraterone or enzalutamide)., ",,CC(C)(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c1,C11H11F3N2O4,CHEMBL491,15.0,25.0,26.0,26.0,26.0,31.0,31.0,43.0,67.0,180.0,200.0,200.0,223.87,230.0,300.0,350.0,7100.0,7690.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2289.74193,15.0,931.3261111,123.5,7690.0,2.969101779,2.091666958,1.176091259,6.030898221,6.908333042,7.823908741,18,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,58.4,26.0,15.0,200.0,7.2335871528876,7.585026652029182,7.823908740944319,6.698970004336019,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

The introduction of a 5-aryl group into the 1,2-dihydrocoumarino[3,4-f]quinoline core 1 is the key for progestational activities. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the 5-aryl substituents generated a series of potent hPR agonists, which exhibited similar biological activity (EC50 = 8-30 nM) to the natural hormone progesterone (EC50 = 2.9 nM) in cell-based assays with efficacies ranging from 28% to 96%. Most of the analogues displayed similar or greater binding affinity (Ki = 0.41-3.6 nM) than progesterone (Ki = 3.5 nM). Three representative analogues (13, 15, and 24) demonstrated in vivo activities in mammary gland morphology/uterine wet weight assay in ovariectomized rats., Entry 1: A novel series of nonsteroidal progestins, 5-benzylidene-1, 2-dihydrochromeno[3,4-f]quinolines (2), was discovered, and a preliminary structure-activity relationship study around the 5-benzylidene ring generated several potent human progesterone receptor agonists (compounds 8, 16). These new progestins showed biological activities (EC50 = 5.7 and 7.6 nM) similar to progesterone (EC50 = 2.9 nM) in the cotransfection assay with high efficacy (132% and 166%) and binding affinity (Ki = 0.66 and 0.83 nM) similar to medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (Ki = 0.34 nM). A representative analogue, 8, demonstrated similar oral potency to MPA in the uterine wet weight/mammary gland morphology assay in ovariectomized rats., Entry 2: A series of 5-benylidene-1,2-dihydrochromeno[3,4-f]quinolines (4) were synthesized and tested in bioassays to evaluate their progestational activities, receptor- and tissue-selectivity profiles as selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs). Most of the new analogues exhibited as highly potent progestins with more than 100-fold receptor selectivity over other steroid hormone receptors and LG120920 (7b) demonstrated tissue selectivity toward uterus and vagina versus breasts in a rodent model after oral administration., Entry 3: A novel class of nonsteroidal progesterone receptor antagonists has been synthesized and was shown to exhibit moderate binding affinity for hPR-A, the ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of human progesterone receptor (hPR) in cell-based assays, and anti-progestational activity in a murine model. Cyclocymopol monomethyl ether, a component of the marine alga Cymopolia barbata was weakly active in random screening against PR. Investigations into the SAR surrounding the core of this natural product lead structure resulted in improved in vitro activity. In contrast to the cross-reactivity profiles observed with known steroidal antiprogestins, compounds of the general structural class described display a high degree of selectivity for the progesterone receptor and no functional activity on the glucocorticoid receptor., Entry 4: A series of 5-methylidene 1,2-dihydrochromeno[3,4-f]quinoline derivatives were synthesized and tested in biological assays to evaluate scope and limitations of the nonsteroidal SPRM pharmacophore (3). A number of orally available highly potent nonsteroidal modulators were identified by modification of the substituents at 5-methylidene position., Entry 5: Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common malignancy in men worldwide. Among current therapies, two antiandrogens, Abiraterone Acetate and Enzalutamide (Enza) have become the standard of care for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we designed and synthesized a new series of nonsteroidal compounds deriving from the hybridization of Abiraterone (Abi) and Enzalutamide, among which compound 4a featuring the diphenylamine scaffold was identified as a potent and cell selective androgen receptor (AR) antagonist. In cell proliferation assays, compound 4a exhibited better antiproliferative activities than Enzalutamide against AR-overexpressing VCaP cells and 22Rv1 cells bearing H874Y-mutated AR. In addition, 4a suppressed the activity of AR-F876L mutant that confers resistance to Enzalutamide and efficiently blocked R1881-induced PSA and FKBP5 gene expression. In competitive binding assay, compound 4a displayed higher binding affinity to AR than Enzalutamide.

While there are a number of drugs that target the AR, they all work through the same mechanism of action and are prone to the development of drug resistance. There is a large unmet need for novel AR inhibitors which work through alternative mechanism(s). Recent studies have identified a novel site on the AR called binding function 3 (BF3) that is involved into AR transcriptional activity. In order to identify inhibitors that target the BF3 site, we have conducted a large-scale in silico screen followed by experimental evaluation. A number of compounds were identified that effectively inhibited the AR transcriptional activity with no obvious cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action of these compounds was validated by biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography. These findings lay a foundation for the development of alternative or supplementary therapies capable of combating prostate cancer even in its antiandrogen resistant forms.",,O=C(O)c1ccccc1Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1,C14H10F3NO2,CHEMBL23588,50000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,50000.0,50000.0,50000.0,50000.0,4.698970004,4.698970004,4.698970004,4.301029996,4.301029996,4.301029996,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,50000.0,50000.0,50000.0,50000.0,4.301029995663981,4.301029995663981,4.301029995663981,4.301029995663981,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

Most of the new analogues exhibited as highly potent progestins with more than 100-fold receptor selectivity over other steroid hormone receptors and LG120920 (7b) demonstrated tissue selectivity toward uterus and vagina versus breasts in a rodent model after oral administration., ",,CC(=O)O[C@]1(C(C)=O)CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3C[C@H](C)C4=CC(=O)CC[C@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@@]21C,C24H34O4,CHEMBL717,6.1,6.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,6.1,6.1,6.1,6.1,0.785329835,0.785329835,0.785329835,8.214670165,8.214670165,8.214670165,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,6.1,6.1,6.1,6.1,8.214670164989233,8.214670164989233,8.214670164989233,8.214670164989233,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

The relative ability of the targeting group to bind to the human androgen receptor was studied as a function of tether. The tether served to attach the antiandrogen to the doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate via an N-Mannich base of a salicylamide derivative. The salicylamide was selected to serve as a trigger release mechanism to separate the doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate from the targeting group after it has bound to the androgen receptor. The remaining part of the tether consisted of a linear group that spanned from the 5-position of the salicylamide to the 3'-position of cyanonilutamide. The structures explored for the linear region of the tether were derivatives of di(ethylene glycol), tri(ethylene glycol), N,N'-disubstituted-piperazine, and 2-butyne-1,4-diol. Relative binding affinity of the tethers bound to the targeting group for human androgen receptor were measured using a (3)H-Mibolerone competition assay and varied from 18% of nilutamide binding for the butynediol-based linear region to less than 1% for one of the piperazine derivatives. The complete targeted drug with the butynediol-based linear region has a relative binding affinity of 10%. This relative binding affinity is encouraging in light of the cocrystal structure of human androgen receptor ligand binding domain bound to the steroid Metribolone which predicts very limited space for a tether connecting the antiandrogen on the inside to the cytotoxin on the outside., Entry 1: The synthesis of a doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate bound to the nonsteroidal anti-androgen cyanonilutamide, via a cleavable tether, and binding of the construct to cell free androgen receptor (AR) as a function of tether design were previously reported. Cyanonilutamide bearing a linear alkyne tether bound to the AR better than other designs. Fluorescence microscopy studies of binding of the lead targeted drug, as well as various tethered cyanonilutamides, to the AR and subsequent trafficking of the resulting AR complex in live PC3 prostate cancer cells transfected with AR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera are now described. Cyanonilutamide and cyanonilutamide bonded to a linear alkyne tether caused translocation of AR-GFP to the nucleus. In general, the ability of tethered cyanonilutamides to cause translocation paralleled their binding affinity for the AR. However, a noncleavable form of the lead cyanonilutamide-doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate bound to AR-GFP but the resulting complex did not translocate to the nucleus. Binding was apparent from the drugs inhibition of Mibolerone-induced translocation. Direct observation of anthraquinone fluorescence of targeted drug in PC3 cells showed initial cytosolic localization, independent of AR expression, with predominant nuclear localization after sufficient time for release of drug from the targeting moiety. The results indicate that doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate bonded to cyanonilutamide via a cleavable linear tether enters PC3 cells, resides in cytosol, binds to the AR if present, and ultimately releases doxorubicin or a doxorubicin derivative to the nucleus., Entry 2: Various 4-(anilino)pyrrole-2-carboxamides were designed and synthesized as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists without steroidal or anilide structure, based on our strategy for developing full antagonists of nuclear receptors. Introduction of a bulky N-alkyl group, such as a cyclohexylmethyl or benzyl group, increased the binding affinity for wild-type AR and the potency for growth inhibition of androgen-dependent SC-3 cells. Among the compounds obtained, N-[4-[(benzyl)(4-nitrophenyl)amino]-1-methylpyrrole-2-carbonyl]pyrrolidine (22) is as potent an AR antagonist as the typical anilide-type AR antagonists hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. Further, compound 22 had potent binding affinity for T877A mutated AR, and dose-dependently inhibited the testosterone-induced production of prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP cells bearing T877A AR., Entry 3: We previously developed carborane-containing potent AR antagonists, BA321 and BA341, on the basis of our hypothesis that the carborane cage would be an excellent hydrophobic pharmacophore in place of steroidal C and D rings. As an extension of that work, we designed and synthesized carborane-containing AR antagonist candidates with a pyridine ring. Compound 6b, which has a pyridine ring directly bound to the p-carborane cage at the 3-position, exhibited potent AR-antagonistic activity in transcriptional activation assay using NIH3T3 cells transfected with a hAR-expression plasmid. In addition, it showed more potent antiandrogenic activity than that of the well-known antiandrogen flutamide and comparable activity to that of (R)-bicalutamide in SC-3 cell proliferation assay., Entry 4: A series of N-benzyl-1-heteroaryl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamides targeting co-activator associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) have been designed and synthesized. The potency of these inhibitors was influenced by the nature of the heteroaryl fragment with the thiophene analogues being superior to thiazole, pyridine, isoindoline and benzofuran based inhibitors., Entry 5: The effect of essential oils, such as raspberry ketone, on androgen (AR) receptor was investigated using a MDA-kb2 human breast cancer cell line for predicting potential AR activity. Among them, eugenol had the highest AR antagonistic activity with its IC(50) value of 19 microM. Raspberry ketone, which has threefold higher anti-obese activity than that of capsaicin, also had AR antagonist activity with its IC(50) value of 252 microM. Based on these findings, a more precise CoMFA model was proposed as follows: pIC(50) [log (1/IC(50))]=3.77+[CoMFA field terms] (n=39, s=0.249, r(2)=0.834, s(cv)=0.507, q(2)=0.311 (three components)., Entry 6: Here, the synthesis and the evaluation of novel 20-aminosteroids on androgen receptor (AR) activity is reported. Compounds 11 and 18 of the series inhibit both the wild type and the T877A mutant AR-mediated transactivation indicating AR antagonistic function. Interestingly, minor structural changes such as stereoisomers of the amino lactame moiety exhibit preferences for antagonism among wild type and mutant AR. Other tested nuclear receptors are only weakly or not affected. In line with this, the prostate cancer cell growth of androgen-dependent but not of cancer cells lacking expression of the AR is inhibited. Further, the expression of the prostate specific antigen used as a diagnostic marker is also repressed. Finally steroid 18 enhances cellular senescence that might explain in part the growth inhibition mediated by this derivative. Steroids 11 and 18 are the first steroids that act as complete AR antagonists and exhibit AR specificity., ",,CC(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c1,C11H11F3N2O3,CHEMBL806,154.0,154.0,580.0,1000.0,2000.0,4200.0,110000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,38043.04519,154.0,16869.71429,1000.0,110000.0,4.227107727,3.0,2.187520721,4.772892273,6.0,6.812479279,7,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,29300.0,3100.0,1000.0,110000.0,4.533132379645891,5.508638306165727,6.0,3.958607314841775,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

While there are a number of drugs that target the AR, they all work through the same mechanism of action and are prone to the development of drug resistance. There is a large unmet need for novel AR inhibitors which work through alternative mechanism(s). Recent studies have identified a novel site on the AR called binding function 3 (BF3) that is involved into AR transcriptional activity. In order to identify inhibitors that target the BF3 site, we have conducted a large-scale in silico screen followed by experimental evaluation. A number of compounds were identified that effectively inhibited the AR transcriptional activity with no obvious cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action of these compounds was validated by biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography. These findings lay a foundation for the development of alternative or supplementary therapies capable of combating prostate cancer even in its antiandrogen resistant forms.",,O=C(O)Cc1cc(I)c(Oc2ccc(O)c(I)c2)c(I)c1,C14H9I3O4,CHEMBL41632,34800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,34800.0,34800.0,34800.0,34800.0,4.541579244,4.541579244,4.541579244,4.458420756,4.458420756,4.458420756,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,34800.0,34800.0,34800.0,34800.0,4.458420756053419,4.458420756053419,4.458420756053419,4.458420756053419,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of silicon-containing bis-phenol derivatives, with the objective of obtaining increased selectivity toward VDR or AR. We found that replacement of the quaternary carbon in the bis-phenol skeleton with silicon increased AR-antagonistic activity and reduced VDR-agonistic activity, that is, the AR selectivity of the silicon-containing compounds was higher than that of corresponding carbon compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear receptor (NR) selectivity switching by sila-substitution (C/Si exchange). Among the compounds synthesized, AR-selective ligand (S,R)-3b exhibited more potent anti-androgenic activity (IC50=0.072 μM) than hydroxyflutamide, a well-known androgen antagonist (IC50=1.4 μM), in SC-3 cell proliferation assay.

Here we describe the discovery of a new class of orally available selective androgen receptor modulators. The lead compound, 6-[(2R,5R)-2-methyl-5-((R)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl]-4-trifluoromethylquinolin-2(1H)-one (6a), showed excellent anabolic activity in muscle with reduced effect on the prostate in a rat model of hypogonadism. The compound also improved bone strength in a rat model of post-menopausal osteoporosis., Entry 2: A series of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) with a wide spectrum of receptor modulating activities was developed based on optimization of the 4-substituted 6-bisalkylamino-2-quinolinones (3). Significance of the trifluoromethyl group on the side chains and its interactions with amino acid residues within the androgen receptor (AR) ligand binding domain are discussed. A representative analog (9) was tested orally in a rodent model of hypogonadism and demonstrated desirable tissue selectivity., Entry 3: Various 4-(anilino)pyrrole-2-carboxamides were designed and synthesized as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists without steroidal or anilide structure, based on our strategy for developing full antagonists of nuclear receptors. Introduction of a bulky N-alkyl group, such as a cyclohexylmethyl or benzyl group, increased the binding affinity for wild-type AR and the potency for growth inhibition of androgen-dependent SC-3 cells. Among the compounds obtained, N-[4-[(benzyl)(4-nitrophenyl)amino]-1-methylpyrrole-2-carbonyl]pyrrolidine (22) is as potent an AR antagonist as the typical anilide-type AR antagonists hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. Further, compound 22 had potent binding affinity for T877A mutated AR, and dose-dependently inhibited the testosterone-induced production of prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP cells bearing T877A AR., Entry 4: We report here the design, preparation, and systematic evaluation of a novel cycloalkane[d]isoxazole pharmacophoric fragment-containing androgen receptor (AR) modulators. Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide). Notably, 6a maintains its antiandrogenic activity with AR mutants W741L and T877A commonly observed and activated by bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, in prostate cancer patients., Entry 5: The androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in multiple physiological functions, including differentiation, growth, and maintenance of male reproductive organs, and also has effects on hair and skin. In this paper, we report the synthesis of nonsteroidal AR antagonists having a 4-benzyl-1-(2H)-phthalazinone skeleton. Among the synthesized compounds, 11c with two ortho-substituents on the phenyl group potently inhibited SC-3 cell proliferation (IC50: 0.18 μM) and showed high wt AR-binding affinity (IC50: 10.9 μM), comparable to that of hydroxyflutamide (3). Compound 11c also inhibited proliferation of LNCaP cells containing T877A-mutated AR. Docking study of 11c with the AR ligand-binding domain indicated that the benzyl group is important for the antagonism. These phthalazinone derivatives may be useful for investigating potential clinical applications of AR antagonists., Entry 6: Prostate cancer is a major cause of male death worldwide and the identification of new and improved treatments is constantly required. Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms. Most of these drugs show limited application due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1). Selected hits demonstrated full AR antagonistic behaviour and promising candidates for further development were identified., Entry 7: The structural modification and molecular docking-based screening approaches on thiazole-based isoindolinediones were imposed to find the novel 2-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl) isoindoline-1,3-dione derivatives. The best fit compounds (6a-n) were synthesized and evaluated their antiproliferative activities on the prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 & LNCaP). Among them, the compound, 6m exhibited good activity, particularly on LNCaP (IC50=5.96±1.6μM), moderately active against PC-3 cell lines as compared to bicalutamide. The compound, 6m decreased the androgen-mediated transcription of ARE-mRNA in PSA, TMPRSS2, c-myc and cyclin D1 than R-bicalutamide. The compounds, 6e and 6f were reconfirmed through single crystal XRD analysis. The ADME profiling of the test compounds was evaluated to find the drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic parameters. These findings may provide vital information for the development of anti-prostate cancer agents., Entry 8: In our effort to find small-molecule treatments of advanced prostate cancers (PCs), a novel series of indolyl and indolinyl propanamides (series II and III) were discovered as selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs). Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs. Design, synthesis, and biological activity of novel SARDs that could potentially be used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of PCs including castration-resistant, Enz-R, and/or AR SV-dependent advanced PCs that are often untreatable with known hormone therapies are discussed., Entry 9: The combination of androgen receptor antagonists with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) has been shown to be more effective than antiandrogens alone in halting growth of prostate cancer cell lines. Here we have designed, synthesized and assessed a series of antiandrogen/HDACi hybrids by combining structural features of enzalutamide with either SAHA or entinostat. The hybrids are demonstrated to maintain bifunctionality using a fluorometric HDAC assay and a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) antiandrogen assay. Antiproliferative assays showed that hybrids bearing o-aminoanilide-based HDACi motifs outperformed hydroxamic acid based HDACi's. The hybrids demonstrated selectivity for epithelial cell lines vs. stromal cell lines, suggesting a potentially useful therapeutic window., ",,C[C@](O)(CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(F)cc1)C(=O)Nc1ccc(C#N)c(C(F)(F)F)c1,C18H14F4N2O4S,CHEMBL63560,120.23,128.0,162.0,248.0,270.0,350.0,490.0,850.0,10000.0,27710.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8405.260696,120.23,4032.823,310.0,27710.0,3.605609161,2.491361694,2.080012847,5.394390839,6.508638306,6.919987153,10,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,136.74333333333334,128.0,120.23,162.0,6.864093837697436,6.892790030352131,6.919987152892072,6.790484985457369,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

We have also shown that a diphenylmethane skeleton can serve as a surrogate for a steroid skeleton. Here, on the basis of those ideas, we hypothesized that the diphenylmethane derivative bisphenol A (BPA) would bind to the ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptors (ERs) in a similar manner to estradiol and act as a steroid surrogate. To test this idea, we synthesized a series of BPA analogs and evaluated their structure-activity relationships, focusing on agonistic/antagonistic activities at ERs and ERα/ERβ subtype selectivity. Among the compounds examined, 18 was found to be a potent ERα-antagonist with high selectivity over ERβ and androgen receptor under our assay conditions. A computational docking study suggested that 18 would bind to the antagonistic conformation of ERα.

This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases., Entry 1: Androgen receptor (AR) antagonists have been widely used for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). As a link between the AR and its transcriptional function, the activation function 2 (AF2) region has recently been revealed as a novel targeting site for developing AR antagonists. Here, we reported a series of <i>N</i>-(4-(benzyloxy)-phenyl)-sulfonamide derivatives as new-scaffold AR antagonists targeting the AR AF2. Therein, compound T1-12 showed excellent AR antagonistic activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.47 μM) and peptide displacement activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 18.05 μM). Furthermore, the in vivo LNCaP xenograft study confirmed that T1-12 offered effective inhibition on tumor growth when administered intratumorally. The study represents the first successful attempt to identify a small molecule targeting the AR AF2 with submicromolar AR antagonistic activity by structure-based virtual screening and provides important clues for the development of novel therapeutics for PCa treatment., ",,CC(=O)O[C@]1(C(C)=O)CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3C=C(Cl)C4=CC(=O)[C@@H]5C[C@@H]5[C@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@@]21C,C24H29ClO4,CHEMBL139835,23.0,258.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,117.8,23.0,140.8,140.8,258.6,2.148602655,2.148602655,1.361727836,6.851397345,6.851397345,7.638272164,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,23.0,23.0,23.0,23.0,7.638272163982407,7.638272163982407,7.638272163982407,7.638272163982407,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

The results demonstrated that at its 4'-position of 5,4'-difluoroflavone the substituents may face Arg752 and that in AR-LBD, the submolecular bulk of substituents is unfavorable for AR antagonists and the negative electrostatic interaction site prefers the stronger hydrogen bond capability of substituents of AR antagonists. The prediction model is a valuable tool for designing a novel AR antagonist., ",,COc1cccc2oc(-c3ccc(F)cc3)cc(=O)c12,C16H11FO3,CHEMBL143978,1610.0,1621.81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.905,1610.0,1615.905,1615.905,1621.81,3.208415825,3.208415825,3.206825876,5.791584175,5.791584175,5.793174124,2,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,1615.905,1615.905,1610.0,1621.81,5.791584175237514,5.791584175237514,5.79317412396815,5.790000026071145,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

The relative ability of the targeting group to bind to the human androgen receptor was studied as a function of tether. The tether served to attach the antiandrogen to the doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate via an N-Mannich base of a salicylamide derivative. The salicylamide was selected to serve as a trigger release mechanism to separate the doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate from the targeting group after it has bound to the androgen receptor. The remaining part of the tether consisted of a linear group that spanned from the 5-position of the salicylamide to the 3'-position of cyanonilutamide. The structures explored for the linear region of the tether were derivatives of di(ethylene glycol), tri(ethylene glycol), N,N'-disubstituted-piperazine, and 2-butyne-1,4-diol. Relative binding affinity of the tethers bound to the targeting group for human androgen receptor were measured using a (3)H-Mibolerone competition assay and varied from 18% of nilutamide binding for the butynediol-based linear region to less than 1% for one of the piperazine derivatives. The complete targeted drug with the butynediol-based linear region has a relative binding affinity of 10%. This relative binding affinity is encouraging in light of the cocrystal structure of human androgen receptor ligand binding domain bound to the steroid Metribolone which predicts very limited space for a tether connecting the antiandrogen on the inside to the cytotoxin on the outside., Entry 1: The synthesis of a doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate bound to the nonsteroidal anti-androgen cyanonilutamide, via a cleavable tether, and binding of the construct to cell free androgen receptor (AR) as a function of tether design were previously reported. Cyanonilutamide bearing a linear alkyne tether bound to the AR better than other designs. Fluorescence microscopy studies of binding of the lead targeted drug, as well as various tethered cyanonilutamides, to the AR and subsequent trafficking of the resulting AR complex in live PC3 prostate cancer cells transfected with AR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera are now described. Cyanonilutamide and cyanonilutamide bonded to a linear alkyne tether caused translocation of AR-GFP to the nucleus. In general, the ability of tethered cyanonilutamides to cause translocation paralleled their binding affinity for the AR. However, a noncleavable form of the lead cyanonilutamide-doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate bound to AR-GFP but the resulting complex did not translocate to the nucleus. Binding was apparent from the drugs inhibition of Mibolerone-induced translocation. Direct observation of anthraquinone fluorescence of targeted drug in PC3 cells showed initial cytosolic localization, independent of AR expression, with predominant nuclear localization after sufficient time for release of drug from the targeting moiety. The results indicate that doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate bonded to cyanonilutamide via a cleavable linear tether enters PC3 cells, resides in cytosol, binds to the AR if present, and ultimately releases doxorubicin or a doxorubicin derivative to the nucleus., Entry 2: The aryl hydantoin 1 (Ro 13-3978) was identified in the early 1980s as a promising antischistosomal lead compound. However, this series of aryl hydantoins produced antiandrogenic side effects in the host, a not unexpected outcome given their close structural similarity to the antiandrogenic drug nilutamide. Building on the known SAR of this compound series, we now describe a number of analogs of 1 designed to maximize structural diversity guided by incorporation of substructures and functional groups known to diminish ligand-androgen receptor interactions. These analogs had calculated polar surface area (PSA), measured LogD, aqueous kinetic solubility, and estimated plasma protein binding values in ranges predictive of good ADME profiles. The principal SAR insight was that the hydantoin core of 1 is required for high antischistosomal activity. We identified several compounds with high antischistosomal efficacy that were less antiandrogenic than 1. These data provide direction for the ongoing optimization of antischistosomal hydantoins., Entry 3: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., ",,CC1(C)NC(=O)N(c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c2)C1=O,C12H10F3N3O4,CHEMBL1274,9.0,9.0,600.0,5000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2089.837374,9.0,1404.5,304.5,5000.0,3.147521744,2.483587297,0.954242509,5.852478256,6.516412703,8.045757491,4,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,2800.0,2800.0,600.0,5000.0,5.552841968657781,5.552841968657781,6.221848749616356,5.301029995663981,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

In the liver glucocorticoid receptor antagonism suppresses hepatic glucose production decreasing plasma glucose levels; however, extrahepatic antagonism produces several undesirable side effects including activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. A series of nonsteroidal passive N-(3-dibenzylamino-2-alkyl-phenyl)-methanesulfonamide glucocorticoid receptor modulators was discovered. Liver selective and systemically available members of this series were found and characterized in diabetes and side effect rodent models. A highly liver selective member of this series, acid 14, shows efficacy in the ob/ob model of diabetes. It lowers plasma glucose, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations and reduces the rate of body weight gain. The structurally related systemically available passive modulator 12 lowers glucose, HbA(1c), triglyceride, free fatty acid, and cholesterol levels. Interestingly, it did not acutely activate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in unstressed CD-1 mice or have the abortive effects observed with 1. These results indicate that passive GR antagonists may have utility as antidiabetic agents.",,Cc1c(NS(C)(=O)=O)cccc1N(Cc1ccccc1)Cc1ccc(Oc2cccc(OCCCC(=O)NCCCC(=O)O)c2)cc1,C36H41N3O7S,CHEMBL185265,1600.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1600.0,1600.0,1600.0,1600.0,3.204119983,3.204119983,3.204119983,5.795880017,5.795880017,5.795880017,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,1600.0,1600.0,1600.0,1600.0,5.795880017344075,5.795880017344075,5.795880017344075,5.795880017344075,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

In the liver glucocorticoid receptor antagonism suppresses hepatic glucose production decreasing plasma glucose levels; however, extrahepatic antagonism produces several undesirable side effects including activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. A series of nonsteroidal passive N-(3-dibenzylamino-2-alkyl-phenyl)-methanesulfonamide glucocorticoid receptor modulators was discovered. Liver selective and systemically available members of this series were found and characterized in diabetes and side effect rodent models. A highly liver selective member of this series, acid 14, shows efficacy in the ob/ob model of diabetes. It lowers plasma glucose, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations and reduces the rate of body weight gain.

Early analogues were poorly soluble and had a propensity to inhibit the hERG channel. Remarkably, both of these challenges were overcome by incorporation of a single carboxylate moiety. Structural modification of carboxylate-containing lead R-4g with a wide range of substituents at each position of the pyrazoline ring resulted in R-12o, which shows excellent activity against MR and reasonable pharmacokinetic profile. Introduction of conformational restriction led to a novel series characterized by exquisite potency and favorable steroid receptor selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. Oral dosing of 3S,3aR-27d (PF-3882845) in the Dahl salt sensitive preclinical model of salt-induced hypertension and nephropathy showed blood pressure attenuation significantly greater than that with eplerenone, reduction in urinary albumin, and renal protection. As a result of these findings, 3S,3aR-27d was advanced to clinical studies., Entry 1: Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade has come into focus as a promising approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. In order to identify a novel class of nonsteroidal MR antagonists that exhibit significant potency and good selectivity over other steroidal hormone receptors, we designed a novel series of benzoxazin-3-one derivatives and synthesized them from 6-(7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazin-6-yl)-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (1a), high-throughput screening (HTS) hit compound. Our design was based on a crystal structure of an MR/compound complex and a docking model. In the course of lead generation from 1a, a 1,2-diaryl framework was characterized as a key structure with high binding affinity. On the basis of scaffold hopping and optimization studies, benzoxazin-3-one derivatives possessing 1-phenyl-3-trifluoromethylpyrazol-5-yl moiety at the 6-position were identified as a novel series of potent and selective MR antagonists. Among these compounds, 6-[1-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (14n) showed highly potent activity and good selectivity and also exhibited a significant antihypertensive effect in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats. On the basis of these results, compound 14n was progressed for further pharmacological evaluation., Entry 2: Novel oxazolidinedione analogs were discovered as potent and selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were focused on improving the potency and microsomal stability. Selected compounds demonstrated excellent MR activity, reasonable nuclear hormone receptor selectivity, and acceptable rat pharmacokinetics., Entry 3: In the course of our study on selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, a series of novel benzoxazine derivatives possessing an azole ring as the core scaffold was designed for the purpose of attenuating the partial agonistic activity of the previously reported dihydropyrrol-2-one derivatives. Screening of alternative azole rings identified 1,3-dimethyl pyrazole 6a as a lead compound with reduced partial agonistic activity. Subsequent replacement of the 1-methyl group of the pyrazole ring with larger lipophilic side chains or polar side chains targeting Arg817 and Gln776 increased MR binding activity while maintaining the agonistic response at the lower level. Among these compounds, 6-[1-(2,2-difluoro-3-hydroxypropyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (37a) showed highly potent in vitro activity, high selectivity versus other steroid hormone receptors, and good pharmacokinetic profiles. Oral administration of 37a in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats showed a significant blood pressure-lowering effect with no signs of antiandrogenic effects., Entry 4: Elaboration of the oxazolidinedione series led to replacement of the exocyclic amides with substituted benzimidazoles. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration resulted in the discovery of potent and selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists with significantly improved microsomal stability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile relative to the HTS hit 1a. One compound 2p possessed comparable efficacy as spironolactone (SPL) at 100 mg/kg (p.o.) in the rat natriuresis model. As such, this series was validated as a lead series for further optimization., Entry 5: Overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is involved in many diseases, such as hypertension, kidney disease, and heart failure. Thus, MR antagonists (MRAs) are expected to be beneficial to patients with these diseases. In order to identify novel nonsteroidal MRAs that overcome the issues of already marketed steroidal MRAs, we searched for new compounds guided by our hypothesis that T-shaped compounds with a hydrophobic core structure, two polar functional groups at both extremities able to interact with MR, and a bulky substituent that can interfere with the folding of the C-terminal helix 12 may exhibit antagonist activity toward MR. We discovered that the novel 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one derivative <b>19</b> (apararenone: MT-3995) acted as a highly selective and potent nonsteroidal MRA. Apararenone exhibited a more potent antihypertensive and organ-protective activity than steroidal MRA eplerenone in a primary aldosteronism rat model obtained by infusing aldosterone in uninephrectomized rats., ",,CC(=O)S[C@@H]1CC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]2(C)[C@H]2CC[C@@]3(C)[C@@H](CC[C@@]34CCC(=O)O4)[C@H]12,C24H32O4S,CHEMBL1393,48.0,120.0,120.0,523.0,670.0,670.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,268.1105183,48.0,358.5,321.5,670.0,2.55448916,2.507180977,1.681241237,6.44551084,6.492819023,7.318758763,6,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,48.0,48.0,48.0,48.0,7.318758762624412,7.318758762624412,7.318758762624412,7.318758762624412,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

These compounds are structurally related to the antiprogestin, antiglucocorticoid, and antiandrogen drug mifepristone (RU486). Nortestosterone analogues bearing 11beta-octyl and 11beta-decyl side-chains bind tightly to recombinant AR protein (IC(50) = 6.6 nM and IC(50) = 0.8 nM), block AR dimerization, exhibit activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and comprise partial AR agonists with low antiglucocorticoid activity., Entry 1: A series of 19-substituted androstenediol derivatives was prepared.

Despite lacking the C-3 hydroxyl previously believed necessary for ER activity, some of the analogs retained surprising affinity for ER-beta. For example, diene 4 retained excellent selectivity and potency as an ER-beta agonist and was more selective for ER-beta over the androgen receptor (AR)., Entry 4: The synthesis and in vitro binding affinity for a novel series of potent androgen receptor modulators is described. One of the more potent compounds (17, RAD35010) was further characterized in vivo where it restored levator ani weight in castrated male rats to near sham level while having no significant effect on prostate weight., Entry 5: We report here the design, preparation, and systematic evaluation of a novel cycloalkane[d]isoxazole pharmacophoric fragment-containing androgen receptor (AR) modulators. Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide). Notably, 6a maintains its antiandrogenic activity with AR mutants W741L and T877A commonly observed and activated by bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, in prostate cancer patients., Entry 6: To circumvent antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer, antiandrogens effective for both the androgen receptor (AR) and AR mutants are required.

Modeling of receptor docking was found to be a useful first step in predicting the potential to translocate to the ligand pocket of the receptor, and the computed interaction energy was found to correlate with the observed binding affinity. Flexible alignment studies of the BFR compounds demonstrated that 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (BCH) closely overlap DHT. Combining the theoretical modeling with in vitro ligand-binding and receptor-activation assays, we show that BCH binds to and activates the human AR.

In pursuit of this, we have discovered a series of novel androgen receptor modulators derived from 7H-[1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones. These compounds were synthesized and evaluated in competitive binding assays and an androgen receptor transcriptional activation assay. A number of compounds from the series demonstrated single-digit nanomolar agonist activity in vitro. In addition, lead compound (R)-16e was orally active in established rodent models that measure androgenic and anabolic properties of these agents.

A molecular modeling study.,PUBLICATION,"Guggulsterone 1, the active principle of guggulipid, has been used in ethnic medicine for thousands of years for its antinflammatory and antilipidemic activities. The activities of 1 are apparently mediated by its interaction with an array of nuclear receptors, including endocrine steroid receptors and metabolic lipid receptors. Although relatively weak, the activity at the metabolic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is particularly intriguing, as 1 is, so far, the only antagonist known for this receptor, with a peculiar ability of gene selective modulation. We report here a systematic study aimed at identifying the potential binding pocket of 1 at FXR. Although 1 could be docked into the canonical binding site, we identified a novel, so far undescribed binding pocket, localized near the loop region between helix 1 and helix 2. This novel binding pocket may explain some of the peculiar characteristics of 1 when acting at FXR.",,C/C=C1/C(=O)C[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@]12C,C21H28O2,CHEMBL402063,220.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,220.0,220.0,220.0,220.0,2.342422681,2.342422681,2.342422681,6.657577319,6.657577319,6.657577319,1,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,220.0,220.0,220.0,220.0,6.657577319177793,6.657577319177793,6.657577319177793,6.657577319177793,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico ""drug repurposing"" procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation.

This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics., Entry 1: Finding good drug leads de novo from large chemical libraries, real or virtual, is not an easy task.

Previously we reported that subtle structural changes with this and related templates produced functional switches between agonist and antagonist properties ( Fensome et al. Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002, 12, 3487; 2003, 13, 1317 ). We herein report a new functional switch within the 5-(2-oxoindolin-5-yl)-1 H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile class of compounds. We found that the size of the 3,3-dialkyl substituent is important for controlling the functional response; thus small groups (dimethyl) afford potent PR antagonists, whereas larger groups (spirocyclohexyl) are PR agonists. The product from our optimization activities in cell-based systems and also for kinetic properties in rodents and nonhuman primates was 5-(7-fluoro-3,3-dimethyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1 H-indol-5-yl)-1-methyl-1 H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile 27 (WAY-255348), which demonstrated potent and robust activity on PR antagonist and contraceptive end points in the rat and also in cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys including ovulation inhibition, menses induction, and reproductive tract morphology., Entry 1: We have developed a new series of progesterone receptor modulators based upon the 4-aryl-phenylsulfonamide.

A molecular modeling study.,PUBLICATION,"Guggulsterone 1, the active principle of guggulipid, has been used in ethnic medicine for thousands of years for its antinflammatory and antilipidemic activities. The activities of 1 are apparently mediated by its interaction with an array of nuclear receptors, including endocrine steroid receptors and metabolic lipid receptors. Although relatively weak, the activity at the metabolic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is particularly intriguing, as 1 is, so far, the only antagonist known for this receptor, with a peculiar ability of gene selective modulation. We report here a systematic study aimed at identifying the potential binding pocket of 1 at FXR. Although 1 could be docked into the canonical binding site, we identified a novel, so far undescribed binding pocket, localized near the loop region between helix 1 and helix 2. This novel binding pocket may explain some of the peculiar characteristics of 1 when acting at FXR.",,C/C=C1\C(=O)C[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@]12C,C21H28O2,CHEMBL410683,660.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,660.0,660.0,660.0,660.0,2.819543936,2.819543936,2.819543936,6.180456064,6.180456064,6.180456064,1,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,660.0,660.0,660.0,660.0,6.180456064458132,6.180456064458132,6.180456064458132,6.180456064458132,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

We found that the size of the 3,3-dialkyl substituent is important for controlling the functional response; thus small groups (dimethyl) afford potent PR antagonists, whereas larger groups (spirocyclohexyl) are PR agonists.

Newly synthesized chalcones 19 and 26 suppressed AR-dependent transcription as well as DHT-dependent growth stimulation at a low micromolar level. These compounds were also effective against ligand-independent constitutively active mutant AR derived from castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Compounds 19 and 26 showed broad spectrum antiproliferative activity at 5-10 μM against multiple tumor cell lines including androgen-independent and taxane-resistant prostate cancer as well as a multidrug-resistant subline. Mode of action studies suggested that 19 induced sub-G1 accumulation in PC-3 cells by disrupting the microtubule network without affecting cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the in vivo effectiveness of chalcone 19 was confirmed in a xenograft model antitumor assay. Thus, chalcone 19 has the potential to be a bifunctional lead for treatment of AR-dependent PCa at lower doses as well as AR-independent PCa, including CRPC, at higher doses.",,COc1ccccc1/C=C/C(=O)c1ccccc1O,C16H14O3,CHEMBL594854,3500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,3500.0,3500.0,3500.0,3500.0,3.544068044,3.544068044,3.544068044,5.455931956,5.455931956,5.455931956,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,3500.0,3500.0,3500.0,3500.0,5.455931955649724,5.455931955649724,5.455931955649724,5.455931955649724,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Early analogues were poorly soluble and had a propensity to inhibit the hERG channel. Remarkably, both of these challenges were overcome by incorporation of a single carboxylate moiety. Structural modification of carboxylate-containing lead R-4g with a wide range of substituents at each position of the pyrazoline ring resulted in R-12o, which shows excellent activity against MR and reasonable pharmacokinetic profile. Introduction of conformational restriction led to a novel series characterized by exquisite potency and favorable steroid receptor selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. Oral dosing of 3S,3aR-27d (PF-3882845) in the Dahl salt sensitive preclinical model of salt-induced hypertension and nephropathy showed blood pressure attenuation significantly greater than that with eplerenone, reduction in urinary albumin, and renal protection. As a result of these findings, 3S,3aR-27d was advanced to clinical studies., Entry 1: Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade has come into focus as a promising approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. In order to identify a novel class of nonsteroidal MR antagonists that exhibit significant potency and good selectivity over other steroidal hormone receptors, we designed a novel series of benzoxazin-3-one derivatives and synthesized them from 6-(7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazin-6-yl)-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (1a), high-throughput screening (HTS) hit compound. Our design was based on a crystal structure of an MR/compound complex and a docking model. In the course of lead generation from 1a, a 1,2-diaryl framework was characterized as a key structure with high binding affinity. On the basis of scaffold hopping and optimization studies, benzoxazin-3-one derivatives possessing 1-phenyl-3-trifluoromethylpyrazol-5-yl moiety at the 6-position were identified as a novel series of potent and selective MR antagonists. Among these compounds, 6-[1-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (14n) showed highly potent activity and good selectivity and also exhibited a significant antihypertensive effect in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats. On the basis of these results, compound 14n was progressed for further pharmacological evaluation., Entry 2: Novel oxazolidinedione analogs were discovered as potent and selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were focused on improving the potency and microsomal stability. Selected compounds demonstrated excellent MR activity, reasonable nuclear hormone receptor selectivity, and acceptable rat pharmacokinetics., Entry 3: In the course of our study on selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, a series of novel benzoxazine derivatives possessing an azole ring as the core scaffold was designed for the purpose of attenuating the partial agonistic activity of the previously reported dihydropyrrol-2-one derivatives. Screening of alternative azole rings identified 1,3-dimethyl pyrazole 6a as a lead compound with reduced partial agonistic activity. Subsequent replacement of the 1-methyl group of the pyrazole ring with larger lipophilic side chains or polar side chains targeting Arg817 and Gln776 increased MR binding activity while maintaining the agonistic response at the lower level. Among these compounds, 6-[1-(2,2-difluoro-3-hydroxypropyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (37a) showed highly potent in vitro activity, high selectivity versus other steroid hormone receptors, and good pharmacokinetic profiles. Oral administration of 37a in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats showed a significant blood pressure-lowering effect with no signs of antiandrogenic effects., Entry 4: Overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is involved in many diseases, such as hypertension, kidney disease, and heart failure. Thus, MR antagonists (MRAs) are expected to be beneficial to patients with these diseases. In order to identify novel nonsteroidal MRAs that overcome the issues of already marketed steroidal MRAs, we searched for new compounds guided by our hypothesis that T-shaped compounds with a hydrophobic core structure, two polar functional groups at both extremities able to interact with MR, and a bulky substituent that can interfere with the folding of the C-terminal helix 12 may exhibit antagonist activity toward MR. We discovered that the novel 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one derivative <b>19</b> (apararenone: MT-3995) acted as a highly selective and potent nonsteroidal MRA. Apararenone exhibited a more potent antihypertensive and organ-protective activity than steroidal MRA eplerenone in a primary aldosteronism rat model obtained by infusing aldosterone in uninephrectomized rats., ",,COC(=O)[C@@H]1CC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]2(C)[C@@]23O[C@@H]2C[C@@]2(C)[C@@H](CC[C@@]24CCC(=O)O4)[C@H]13,C24H30O6,CHEMBL1095097,10000.0,10000.0,10000.0,17000.0,20000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4270.831301,10000.0,13400.0,10000.0,20000.0,4.127104798,4.0,4.0,4.872895202,5.0,5.0,5,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,10000.0,10000.0,10000.0,10000.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

Pharmacological assays indicated that CH5137291 (17b) was a potent AR pure antagonist which did not produce the agonist metabolite.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,CC1(C)C(=O)N(c2ccc(C#N)c(Cl)c2)C(=S)N1CCCS(N)(=O)=O,C15H17ClN4O3S2,CHEMBL1099086,10.0,12.0,200.0,410.0,440.0,440.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,189.0855186,10.0,252.0,305.0,440.0,2.401400541,2.484299839,1.0,6.598599459,6.515700161,8.0,6,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,410.0,410.0,410.0,410.0,6.3872161432802645,6.3872161432802645,6.3872161432802645,6.3872161432802645,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

prostate cancer. All current antiandrogens, such as Bicalutamide, Flutamide, Nilutamide, and Enzalutamide, target the buried hydrophobic androgen binding pocket of this protein. However, effective resistance mechanisms against these therapeutics exist such as mutations occurring at the target site. To overcome these limitations, the surface pocket of the AR called binding function 3 (BF3) was characterized as an alternative target for small molecule therapeutics. A number of AR inhibitors directly targeting the BF3 were previously identified by us (  J. Med. Chem.     2011 .  54  ,   8563  ). In the current study, based on the prior results, we have developed structure-activity relationships that allowed designing a series of 2-((2-phenoxyethyl)thio)-1H-benzimidazole and 2-((2-phenoxyethyl)thio)-1H-indole as lead BF3 inhibitors. Some of the developed BF3 ligands demonstrated significant antiandrogen potency against LNCaP and Enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell lines., Entry 1: A library of 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydropyridones was synthesized, and their activities as antiandrogens were tested in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies resulted in the identification of a potent compound whose activity is comparable to that of MDV3100. Homology modeling and molecular mechanics were used to build a structural model of the androgen receptor-ligand binding domain and to investigate the structural basis of the antagonism. The model is qualitatively consistent with the observed SAR. Moreover, the enrichment plot shows that screening with the model performs significantly better than random screening. Therefore, the model probably represents a realistic conformation of the antagonist form and can be utilized for structure-based design of novel antiandrogens., Entry 2: Prostate cancer is a major cause of male death worldwide and the identification of new and improved treatments is constantly required. Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms. Most of these drugs show limited application due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1). Selected hits demonstrated full AR antagonistic behaviour and promising candidates for further development were identified., Entry 3: While enzalutamide and abiraterone are approved for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), approximately 20-40% of patients have no response to these agents. It has been stipulated that the lack of response and the development of secondary resistance to these drugs may be due to the presence of AR splice variants. HDAC6 has a role in regulating the androgen receptor (AR) by modulating heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) acetylation, which controls the nuclear localization and activation of the AR in androgen-dependent and independent scenarios. With dual-acting AR-HDAC6 inhibitors it should be possible to target patients who don't respond to enzalutamide. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of dual-acting compounds which target AR and are also specific towards HDAC6. Our efforts led to compound 10 which was found to have potent dual activity (HDAC6 IC50=0.0356μM and AR binding IC50=<0.03μM). Compound 10 was further evaluated for antagonist and other cell-based activities, in vitro stability and pharmacokinetics., Entry 4: Prostate cancer (PC) is a major cause of cancer-related male death in worldwide and the identification of new and improved potent anti-PC molecules is constantly required. A novel scaffold of tetrahydroisoquinoline thiohydantoin was rationally designed based on the enzalutamide structures and our pre-work, leading to the discovery of a series of new antiproliferative compounds. Several new analogues displayed improved androgen receptor (AR) antagonistic activity, while maintaining the higher selective toxicity toward LNCaP cells (AR-rich) versus DU145 cells (AR-deficient) compared to enzalutamide. In fact, compound 55 exhibited promising in vitro antitumor activity by impairing AR unclear translocation. More importantly, 55 showed better pharmacokinetic properties compared to the compound 1 reported in our pre-work. These results demonstrate a step towards the development of novel and improved AR antagonists., Entry 5: The androgen receptor (AR) is a hormone-activated transcription factor that regulates the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) and represents one of the most well-established drug targets. Currently clinically approved small molecule inhibitors of AR, such as enzalutamide, are built upon a common chemical scaffold that interacts with the AR by the same mechanism of action. These inhibitors eventually fail due to the emergence of drug-resistance in the form of AR mutations and expression of truncated AR splice variants (e.g. AR-V7) that are constitutively active, signalling the progression of the castration-resistant state of the disease. The urgent need therefore continues for novel classes of AR inhibitors that can overcome drug resistance, especially since AR signalling remains important even in late-stage advanced PCa. Previously, we identified a collection of 10-benzylidene-10H-anthracen-9-ones that effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, induce AR degradation and display some ability to block recruitment of hormones to the receptor. In the current work, we extended the analysis of the lead compounds, and used methods of both ligand- and structure-based drug design to develop a panel of novel 10-benzylidene-10H-anthracen-9-one derivatives capable of suppressing transcriptional activity and protein expression levels of both full length- and AR-V7 truncated forms of human androgen receptor. Importantly, the developed compounds efficiently inhibited the growth of AR-V7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens., Entry 6: The androgen receptor (AR) is a hormone-activated transcription factor that regulates the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) and represents one of the most well-established drug targets.

Among current therapies, two antiandrogens, Abiraterone Acetate and Enzalutamide (Enza) have become the standard of care for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we designed and synthesized a new series of nonsteroidal compounds deriving from the hybridization of Abiraterone (Abi) and Enzalutamide, among which compound 4a featuring the diphenylamine scaffold was identified as a potent and cell selective androgen receptor (AR) antagonist. In cell proliferation assays, compound 4a exhibited better antiproliferative activities than Enzalutamide against AR-overexpressing VCaP cells and 22Rv1 cells bearing H874Y-mutated AR. In addition, 4a suppressed the activity of AR-F876L mutant that confers resistance to Enzalutamide and efficiently blocked R1881-induced PSA and FKBP5 gene expression. In competitive binding assay, compound 4a displayed higher binding affinity to AR than Enzalutamide. These results suggest compound 4a as a potential candidate to treat Enza-resistant CRPC., Entry 8: In our effort to find small-molecule treatments of advanced prostate cancers (PCs), a novel series of indolyl and indolinyl propanamides (series II and III) were discovered as selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs). Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs. Design, synthesis, and biological activity of novel SARDs that could potentially be used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of PCs including castration-resistant, Enz-R, and/or AR SV-dependent advanced PCs that are often untreatable with known hormone therapies are discussed., Entry 9: Androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in the development of prostate cancer (PCa), and therefore it has been regarded as the most important therapeutic target for both hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and advanced PCa. In this study, a novel hit (C18) with IC of 2.4 μM against AR transcriptional activity in LNCaP cell was identified through structure-based virtual screening based on molecular docking and free energy calculations. The structure-activity relationship analysis and structural optimization of C18 resulted in the discovery of a structural analogue (AT2), a more potent AR antagonist with 16-fold improved anti-AR potency. Further assays indicated that AT2 was capable of effectively inhibiting the transcriptional function of AR and blocking the nuclear translocation of AR like the second-generation AR antagonists. The antagonists discovered in this study may be served as the promising lead compounds for the development of AR-driven PCa therapeutics., Entry 10: Androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in the development of prostate cancer (PCa), and therefore it has been regarded as the most important therapeutic target for both hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and advanced PCa.

The androgen receptor (AR) has become a promising drug target for the treatment of PC. Here, we reported the design, optimization and evaluation of pyridine tetrahydroisoquinoline thiohydantoin derivatives with improved activity and safety as potent AR antagonists. The most promising compound 42f exhibited potent inhibitory activity on AR and strongly blocked AR nuclear translocation. Moreover, 42f displayed promising in vitro antitumor activity toward AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP) and also demonstrated therapeutic effects in LNCaP xenograft tumor model in mice (TGI: 79%) with no apparent toxicity observed in vivo. More importantly, 42f showed negligible penetration of the brain-blood barrier (BBB) compared with enzalutamide. These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of androgen receptor antagonists for potential therapeutics against PC with lower seizurogenic risk for patients., Entry 12: We report herein the design, synthesis, and pharmacological characterization of a library of novel aryl pyrazol-1-yl-propanamides as selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) and pan-antagonists that exert broad-scope AR antagonism. Pharmacological evaluation demonstrated that introducing a pyrazole moiety as the B-ring structural element in the common A-ring-linkage-B-ring nonsteroidal antiandrogens' general pharmacophore allowed the development of a new scaffold of small molecules with unique SARD and pan-antagonist activities even compared to our recently published AF-1 binding SARDs such as UT-155 (9) and UT-34 (10). Novel B-ring pyrazoles exhibited potent AR antagonist activities, including promising distribution, metabolism, and pharmacokinetic properties, and broad-spectrum AR antagonist properties, including potent in vivo antitumor activity. 26a was able to induce an 80% tumor growth inhibition of xenografts derived from the enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) VCaP cell line. These results represent an advancement toward the development of novel AR antagonists for the treatment of Enz-R prostate cancer., Entry 13: Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common malignancy in men worldwide. Here, two series of novel thiohydantoin derivatives of enzalutamide as potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonists were designed and synthesized. Among them, compound 31c was identified as an AR antagonist which is 2.3-fold more potent than enzalutamide. Molecular docking studies were performed to explain the improved potency of 31c at AR. In cell proliferation assays, 31c exhibited similar anti-proliferative activities with enzalutamide against hormone sensitive LNCaP cells and AR-overexpressing LNCaP/AR cells. These data indicate that 31c can be a good lead compound for further structure optimization for the treatment of prostate cancer., Entry 14: 48 new drugs including 38 chemical entities (33 new chemical entities, 3 new diagnostic agents, and 2 payloads of antibody drug conjugates) and 10 biologics were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during 2019. These marketed new drugs represent privileged structures and novel action of mechanism, and thus can be served as leads to discover new drugs with the similar biological targets and improved therapeutic efficacy. This review aims to provide an overview regarding the synthetic approaches of 33 new chemical entities approved by the FDA in 2019 and their clinical applications., Entry 15: A series of propanamide derivatives were designed, synthesized, and pharmacologically characterized as selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) and pan-antagonists that exert a broad-scope androgen receptor (AR) antagonism. Incorporating different basic heteromonocyclic B-ring structural elements in the common A-ring-linkage-B-ring nonsteroidal antiandrogen general pharmacophore contributed to a novel scaffold of small molecules with SARD and pan-antagonist activities even compared to our recently published AF-1 binding SARDs such as UT-69 (<b>11</b>), UT-155 (<b>12</b>), and UT-34 (<b>13</b>). Compound <b>26f</b> exhibited inhibitory and degradation effects in vitro in a wide array of wtAR, point mutant, and truncation mutant-driven prostate cancers (PCs). Further, <b>26f</b> inhibited tumor cell growth in a xenograft model composed of enzalutamide-resistant (EnzR) LNCaP cells. These results demonstrate an advancement toward the development of novel SARDs and pan-antagonists with efficacy against EnzR prostate cancers., Entry 16: Persistent androgen receptor (AR) activation drives therapeutic resistance to second-generation AR pathway inhibitors and contributes to the progression of advanced prostate cancer. One resistance mechanism is point mutations in the ligand binding domain of AR that can transform antagonists into agonists. The AR F877L mutation, identified in patients treated with enzalutamide or apalutamide, confers resistance to both enzalutamide and apalutamide. Compound <b>4</b> (JNJ-pan-AR) was identified as a pan-AR antagonist with potent activity against wild-type and clinically relevant AR mutations including F877L. Metabolite identification studies revealed a latent bioactivation pathway associated with <b>4</b>. Subsequent lead optimization of <b>4</b> led to amelioration of this pathway and nomination of <b>5</b> (JNJ-63576253) as a clinical stage, next-generation AR antagonist for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)., Entry 17: Persistent androgen receptor (AR) activation drives therapeutic resistance to second-generation AR pathway inhibitors and contributes to the progression of advanced prostate cancer.

Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) Binding Function-3 (BF3) site offers a promising option to treat CRPC. However, BF3 inhibitors have been limited by poor potency or inadequate metabolic stability. Through extensive medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, and biochemistry, we identified 2-(5,6,7-trifluoro-1<i>H</i>-Indol-3-yl)-quinoline-5-carboxamide (VPC-13789), a potent AR BF3 antagonist with markedly improved pharmacokinetic properties. We demonstrate that VPC-13789 suppresses AR-mediated transcription, chromatin binding, and recruitment of coregulatory proteins. This novel AR antagonist selectively reduces the growth of both androgen-dependent and enzalutamide-resistant PCa cell lines. Having demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> efficacy, we developed an orally bioavailable prodrug that reduced PSA production and tumor volume in animal models of CRPC with no observed toxicity. VPC-13789 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable antiandrogen with a distinct mode of action that has a potential as novel CRPC therapeutics., Entry 19: Androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional reactivation plays a key role in the development and progression of lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recurrent alterations in the AR enable persistent AR pathway signaling and drive resistance to the treatment of second-generation antiandrogens. AR F877L, a point mutation in the ligand binding domain of the AR, was identified in patients who acquired resistance to enzalutamide or apalutamide. In parallel to our previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of compound <b>4</b> (JNJ-pan-AR) and clinical stage compound <b>5</b> (JNJ-63576253), we discovered additional AR antagonists that provide opportunities for future development. Here we report a highly potent series of spirocyclic thiohydantoins as AR antagonists for the treatment of the F877L mutant and wild-type CRPC., Entry 20: Androgen receptor (AR) has proved to be a vital drug target for treating prostate cancer. Here, we reported the discovery of a novel AR antagonist <b>92</b> targeting the AR ligand-binding pocket, but distinct from the marketed drug enzalutamide (Enz), <b>92</b> demonstrated inhibition on the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) dimerization, which is a novel mechanism reported for the first time. First, a novel hit (<b>26</b>, IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.57 μM) was identified through virtual screening based on a theoretical AR LBD dimer bound with the Enz model. Then, guided by molecular modeling, <b>92</b> was discovered with 32.7-fold improved AR antagonistic activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.17 μM). Besides showing high bioactivity and safety, <b>92</b> can inhibit AR nuclear translocation. Furthermore, <b>92</b> inhibited the formation of the AR LBD dimer, possibly through attenuating the hydrogen-bonding network between the two monomers. This interesting finding would pave the way for the discovery of a new class of AR antagonists., Entry 21: Androgen receptor (AR) antagonists have been widely used for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). As a link between the AR and its transcriptional function, the activation function 2 (AF2) region has recently been revealed as a novel targeting site for developing AR antagonists. Here, we reported a series of <i>N</i>-(4-(benzyloxy)-phenyl)-sulfonamide derivatives as new-scaffold AR antagonists targeting the AR AF2. Therein, compound T1-12 showed excellent AR antagonistic activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.47 μM) and peptide displacement activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 18.05 μM). Furthermore, the in vivo LNCaP xenograft study confirmed that T1-12 offered effective inhibition on tumor growth when administered intratumorally. The study represents the first successful attempt to identify a small molecule targeting the AR AF2 with submicromolar AR antagonistic activity by structure-based virtual screening and provides important clues for the development of novel therapeutics for PCa treatment., Entry 22: Androgen receptor (AR) has proved to be a vital drug target for treating prostate cancer.

All the approved AR antagonists to date are targeted to the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of AR and have suffered from various drug resistances, whereas AR antagonist targeting non-LBP site of AR is conceived as a promising strategy. Through the scaffold hopping of AR LBP antagonists, the 2-chloro-4-(1<i>H</i>-pyrazol-1-yl)benzonitrile was designed as a new core structure for AR antagonists. A total of 46 compounds were synthesized and biologically evaluated to disclose compounds <b>2f</b>, <b>2k</b>, and <b>4c</b>, exhibiting potent AR antagonistic activities (IC<sub>50</sub> up to 69 nM), force against antiandrogen resistance, and untraditional targeting site of probably AR binding function 3. Therein, <b>4c</b> exhibited effective tumor growth inhibition in LNCaP xenograft study upon oral administration. This work provides a novel chemical scaffold for AR antagonists and offers new perspective for the development of PCa therapy., Entry 25: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with high mortality has seriously threatened men's health. Bifunctional agents simultaneously degrade and antagonize androgen receptor (AR), display robust AR signaling pathway blockade, and show the therapeutic prospect for mCRPC. Herein, systemic structural modifications on the C-3, C-6, and C-17 positions of galeterone led to the discovery of <b>67-b</b> with the dual functions of AR antagonism and degradation. <i>In vitro</i>, <b>67-b</b> exhibited excellent antiproliferative activity and potent AR degradation activity in different PCa cells (LNCaP and 22RV1), as well as outstanding antagonistic activity against wild-type and mutant (W741L, T877A, and F876L) ARs. <i>In vivo</i>, <b>67-b</b> effectively inhibited the growth of hormone-sensitive organs in the Hershberger assay and exhibited tumor regression in the enzalutamide-resistant (c4-2b-ENZ) xenograft model.

Here we have designed, synthesized and assessed a series of antiandrogen/HDACi hybrids by combining structural features of enzalutamide with either SAHA or entinostat. The hybrids are demonstrated to maintain bifunctionality using a fluorometric HDAC assay and a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) antiandrogen assay. Antiproliferative assays showed that hybrids bearing o-aminoanilide-based HDACi motifs outperformed hydroxamic acid based HDACi's. The hybrids demonstrated selectivity for epithelial cell lines vs. stromal cell lines, suggesting a potentially useful therapeutic window., ",,CNC(=O)c1ccc(N2C(=S)N(c3ccc(C#N)c(C(F)(F)F)c3)C(=O)C2(C)C)cc1F,C21H16F4N4O2S,CHEMBL1082407,14.0,21.0,25.0,36.0,38.0,50.0,70.0,75.0,80.0,90.0,112.0,117.0,117.0,216.0,216.0,216.0,219.0,361.0,450.0,480.0,492.0,647.0,1260.0,3030.0,3970.0,5336.0,5600.0,100000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18462.8475,14.0,4404.935714,216.0,100000.0,3.643939575,2.334453751,1.146128036,5.356060425,6.665546249,7.853871964,28,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,231.33333333333334,216.0,117.0,361.0,6.635761784264807,6.665546248849069,6.931814138253839,6.442492798094342,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects.

Early analogues were poorly soluble and had a propensity to inhibit the hERG channel. Remarkably, both of these challenges were overcome by incorporation of a single carboxylate moiety. Structural modification of carboxylate-containing lead R-4g with a wide range of substituents at each position of the pyrazoline ring resulted in R-12o, which shows excellent activity against MR and reasonable pharmacokinetic profile. Introduction of conformational restriction led to a novel series characterized by exquisite potency and favorable steroid receptor selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. Oral dosing of 3S,3aR-27d (PF-3882845) in the Dahl salt sensitive preclinical model of salt-induced hypertension and nephropathy showed blood pressure attenuation significantly greater than that with eplerenone, reduction in urinary albumin, and renal protection.

cell-based cotransfection assays with human androgen receptor (hAR). This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases., Entry 1: We report the discovery of a novel class of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists based on the chromene molecular scaffold. The compounds exhibit good functional potency and an improved receptor selectivity profile for GR over other steroid receptors when compared to the classical steroidal GR-antagonist, RU-486., Entry 2: Novel 6-aryl-1,4-dihydro-benzo[d][1,3]oxazin-2-ones were synthesized and tested as progesterone receptor (PR) antagonists. These compounds were potent and showed good selectivity for PR over other steroid receptors such as the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors (e.g., greater than 80-fold selectivity at PR for 4h). Numerous 6-aryl benzoxazinones (e.g., 4h-j) were active orally in the uterine decidualization and component C3 assays in the rats. In these in vivo models,4h had potencies comparable to mifepristone., Entry 3: A novel class of nonsteroidal progesterone receptor antagonists has been synthesized and was shown to exhibit moderate binding affinity for hPR-A, the ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of human progesterone receptor (hPR) in cell-based assays, and anti-progestational activity in a murine model. Cyclocymopol monomethyl ether, a component of the marine alga Cymopolia barbata was weakly active in random screening against PR. Investigations into the SAR surrounding the core of this natural product lead structure resulted in improved in vitro activity. In contrast to the cross-reactivity profiles observed with known steroidal antiprogestins, compounds of the general structural class described display a high degree of selectivity for the progesterone receptor and no functional activity on the glucocorticoid receptor., Entry 4: A series of 1,2-dihydrochromeno[3,4-f]quinoline derivatives was synthesized and tested in biological assays to evaluate the nonsteroidal progesterone receptor modulator pharmacophore (4) as antiprogestins. A number of potent analogues were identified by modification of the substituents at the D-ring., Entry 5: Herein we describe the chemical synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a novel, highly potent progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist, ZK 230211. The introduction of a 17alpha-pentafluorethyl side chain in the D-ring of the steroid skeleton allowed the combination of high antiprogestagenic activity with little or no other endocrinological effects. In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects. In tumor models ZK 230211 exhibited strong antiproliferative action. The pharmacological properties of ZK 230211 may prove useful in the treatment of endometriosis, leiomyomas, breast cancer, and in hormone replacement therapy., Entry 6: We report the synthesis of novel steroidal androgen receptor ligands comprising 11beta-alkyl-Delta(9)-derivatives of 19-nortestosterone. These compounds are structurally related to the antiprogestin, antiglucocorticoid, and antiandrogen drug mifepristone (RU486). Nortestosterone analogues bearing 11beta-octyl and 11beta-decyl side-chains bind tightly to recombinant AR protein (IC(50) = 6.6 nM and IC(50) = 0.8 nM), block AR dimerization, exhibit activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and comprise partial AR agonists with low antiglucocorticoid activity., Entry 7: We report the synthesis of novel steroidal androgen receptor ligands comprising 11beta-alkyl-Delta(9)-derivatives of 19-nortestosterone. These compounds are structurally related to the antiprogestin, antiglucocorticoid, and antiandrogen drug mifepristone (RU486). Nortestosterone analogues bearing 11beta-octyl and 11beta-decyl side-chains bind tightly to recombinant AR protein (IC(50) = 6.6 nM and IC(50) = 0.8 nM), block AR dimerization, exhibit activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and comprise partial AR agonists with low antiglucocorticoid activity., Entry 8: Much has been learned about the consequences of glucocorticoid receptor antagonism by studying steroidal active antagonists such as RU-38486 (1). In the liver glucocorticoid receptor antagonism suppresses hepatic glucose production decreasing plasma glucose levels; however, extrahepatic antagonism produces several undesirable side effects including activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. A series of nonsteroidal passive N-(3-dibenzylamino-2-alkyl-phenyl)-methanesulfonamide glucocorticoid receptor modulators was discovered. Liver selective and systemically available members of this series were found and characterized in diabetes and side effect rodent models. A highly liver selective member of this series, acid 14, shows efficacy in the ob/ob model of diabetes. It lowers plasma glucose, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations and reduces the rate of body weight gain. The structurally related systemically available passive modulator 12 lowers glucose, HbA(1c), triglyceride, free fatty acid, and cholesterol levels. Interestingly, it did not acutely activate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in unstressed CD-1 mice or have the abortive effects observed with 1. These results indicate that passive GR antagonists may have utility as antidiabetic agents., Entry 9: We report the synthesis of novel steroidal androgen receptor ligands comprising 11beta-alkyl-Delta(9)-derivatives of 19-nortestosterone. These compounds are structurally related to the antiprogestin, antiglucocorticoid, and antiandrogen drug mifepristone (RU486). Nortestosterone analogues bearing 11beta-octyl and 11beta-decyl side-chains bind tightly to recombinant AR protein (IC(50) = 6.6 nM and IC(50) = 0.8 nM), block AR dimerization, exhibit activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and comprise partial AR agonists with low antiglucocorticoid activity., Entry 10: We have continued to explore the 3,3-dialkyl-5-aryloxindole series of progesterone receptor (PR) modulators looking for new agents to be used in female healthcare: contraception, fibroids, endometriosis, and certain breast cancers. Previously we reported that subtle structural changes with this and related templates produced functional switches between agonist and antagonist properties ( Fensome et al. Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002, 12, 3487; 2003, 13, 1317 ). We herein report a new functional switch within the 5-(2-oxoindolin-5-yl)-1 H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile class of compounds. We found that the size of the 3,3-dialkyl substituent is important for controlling the functional response; thus small groups (dimethyl) afford potent PR antagonists, whereas larger groups (spirocyclohexyl) are PR agonists. The product from our optimization activities in cell-based systems and also for kinetic properties in rodents and nonhuman primates was 5-(7-fluoro-3,3-dimethyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1 H-indol-5-yl)-1-methyl-1 H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile 27 (WAY-255348), which demonstrated potent and robust activity on PR antagonist and contraceptive end points in the rat and also in cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys including ovulation inhibition, menses induction, and reproductive tract morphology., Entry 11: A series of novel 7-(5'-cyanopyrrol-2-yl) substituted benzo[1,4]oxazepin-2-ones were prepared and tested for their progesterone receptor (PR) agonist or antagonist activity in the alkaline phosphatase assay using the human T47D breast carcinoma cell line. Both PR agonists and antagonists were achieved with an appropriate choice of 5-substitution. Several analogs were potent PR agonists (e.g., 12 and 13) or PR antagonists (e.g., 18) with good selectivity over other steroid receptors., Entry 12: Novel 7-aryl benzo[1,4]oxazepin-2-ones were synthesized and evaluated as non-steroidal progesterone receptor (PR) modulators. The structure activity relationship of 7-aryl benzo[1,4]oxazepinones was examined using the T47D cell alkaline phosphatase assay. A number of 7-aryl benzo[1,4]oxazepinones such as 10j and 10v demonstrated good in vitro potency (IC(50) of 10-30 nM) and selectivity (over 100-fold) at PR over other steroidal receptors such as glucocorticoid and androgen receptors (GR and AR). Several 7-aryl benzo[1,4]oxazepinones were active in the rat uterine decidualization model. In this in vivo model, compounds 10j and 10u were active at 3 mg/kg when dosed orally., Entry 13: Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists have been used for more than half a century as the most effective treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions despite serious side effects that accompany their extended use that include glucose intolerance, muscle wasting, skin thinning, and osteoporosis. As a starting point for the identification of GR ligands with an improved therapeutic index, we wished to discover selective nonsteroidal GR agonists and antagonists with simplified structure compared to known GR ligands to serve as starting points for the optimization of dissociated GR modulators. To do so, we selected multiple chemical series by structure guided docking studies and evaluated GR agonist activity. From these efforts we identified 5-arylindazole compounds that showed moderate binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with clear opportunities for further development. Structure guided optimization was used to design arrays that led to potent GR agonists and antagonists. Several in vitro and in vivo experiments were utilized to demonstrate that GR agonist 23a (GSK9027) had a profile similar to that of a classical steroidal GR agonist., Entry 14: A novel class of non-steroidal progesterone receptor antagonists with aromatic beta-amino-ketone scaffold have been synthesized and characterized with high binding affinity and great selectivity for the cognate receptors. Among them, compound 22 was shown to be the most potent progesterone receptor antagonist in cotransfection assay and a murine model of ligand-induced decidualization., Entry 15: Non-steroidal 1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile containing tetrahydronaphthalenes and acyclic derivatives were evaluated as novel series of progesterone receptor (PR) antagonists using the T47D cell alkaline phosphatase assay. Moderate to potent PR antagonists were achieved with these scaffolds. Several compounds (e.g., 15 and 20) demonstrated low nanomolar PR antagonist potency and good selectivity versus other steroid receptors., Entry 16: The progesterone receptor (PR) plays an important role in various physiological systems, including female reproduction and the central nervous system, and PR antagonists are thought to be effective not only as contraceptive agents and abortifacients but also in the treatment of various diseases, including hormone-dependent cancers and endometriosis. Here, we identified phenanthridin-6(5H)-one derivatives as a new class of PR antagonists and investigated their structure-activity relationships. Among the synthesized compounds, 37, 40, and 46 exhibited very potent PR antagonistic activity with high selectivity for PR over other nuclear receptors. These compounds are structurally distinct from other nonsteroidal PR antagonists, including cyanoaryl derivatives, and should be useful for further studies of the clinical utility of PR antagonists., ",,CC#C[C@]1(O)CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4=C3[C@@H](c3ccc(N(C)C)cc3)C[C@@]21C,C29H35NO2,CHEMBL1276308,1.0,2.2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.9,8.0,8.0,8.8,10.0,23.0,63.0,89.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.05247362,1.0,15.34117647,6.9,89.0,1.185858666,0.838849091,0.0,7.814141334,8.161150909,9.0,17,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,16.97142857142857,5.0,1.0,89.0,7.770281599369082,8.301029995663981,9.0,7.050609993355087,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

All current antiandrogens, such as Bicalutamide, Flutamide, Nilutamide, and Enzalutamide, target the buried hydrophobic androgen binding pocket of this protein. However, effective resistance mechanisms against these therapeutics exist such as mutations occurring at the target site. To overcome these limitations, the surface pocket of the AR called binding function 3 (BF3) was characterized as an alternative target for small molecule therapeutics. A number of AR inhibitors directly targeting the BF3 were previously identified by us (  J. Med. Chem.     2011 .  54  ,   8563  ). In the current study, based on the prior results, we have developed structure-activity relationships that allowed designing a series of 2-((2-phenoxyethyl)thio)-1H-benzimidazole and 2-((2-phenoxyethyl)thio)-1H-indole as lead BF3 inhibitors. Some of the developed BF3 ligands demonstrated significant antiandrogen potency against LNCaP and Enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell lines., ",,Cc1ccc(OCCn2c(SCCOc3ccccc3)nc3ccccc32)cc1,C24H24N2O2S,CHEMBL1738936,10000.0,13100.0,13100.0,50000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16474.29816,10000.0,21550.0,13100.0,50000.0,4.333447274,4.117271296,4.0,4.666552726,4.882728704,5.0,4,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,10000.0,10000.0,10000.0,10000.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of silicon-containing bis-phenol derivatives, with the objective of obtaining increased selectivity toward VDR or AR. We found that replacement of the quaternary carbon in the bis-phenol skeleton with silicon increased AR-antagonistic activity and reduced VDR-agonistic activity, that is, the AR selectivity of the silicon-containing compounds was higher than that of corresponding carbon compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear receptor (NR) selectivity switching by sila-substitution (C/Si exchange). Among the compounds synthesized, AR-selective ligand (S,R)-3b exhibited more potent anti-androgenic activity (IC50=0.072 μM) than hydroxyflutamide, a well-known androgen antagonist (IC50=1.4 μM), in SC-3 cell proliferation assay. These results suggest that sila-substitution is a useful approach for structural development of selective AR ligands.",,CC[Si](CC)(c1ccc(OCC(=O)C(C)(C)C)c(C)c1)c1ccc(OCC(=O)C(C)(C)C)c(C)c1,C30H44O4Si,CHEMBL1783642,6200.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,6200.0,6200.0,6200.0,6200.0,3.792391689,3.792391689,3.792391689,5.207608311,5.207608311,5.207608311,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,6200.0,6200.0,6200.0,6200.0,5.2076083105017466,5.2076083105017466,5.2076083105017466,5.2076083105017466,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.

Inhibition of androgen biosynthesis and/or AR antagonism should be efficacious in the treatment of CRPC. AKR1C3 catalyzes the formation of potent AR ligands from inactive precursors and is one of the most upregulated genes in CRPC. AKR1C3 inhibitors should not inhibit the related isoforms, AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 that are involved in 5α-dihydrotestosterone inactivation in the prostate. We have previously developed a series of flufenamic acid analogs as potent and selective AKR1C3 inhibitors [Adeniji, A. O. et al., J. Med. Chem.2012, 55, 2311]. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of one lead compound 3-((4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) amino)benzoic acid (1) in complex with AKR1C3. Compound 1 adopts a similar binding orientation as flufenamic acid, however, its phenylamino ring projects deeper into a subpocket and confers selectivity over the other AKR1C isoforms. We exploited the observation that some flufenamic acid analogs also act as AR antagonists and synthesized a second generation inhibitor, 3-((4-nitronaphthalen-1-yl)amino)benzoic acid (2). Compound 2 retained nanomolar potency and selective inhibition of AKR1C3 but also acted as an AR antagonist. It inhibited 5α-dihydrotestosterone stimulated AR reporter gene activity with an IC(50)=4.7 μM and produced a concentration dependent reduction in androgen receptor levels in prostate cancer cells. The in vitro and cell-based effects of compound 2 make it a promising lead for development of dual acting agent for CRPC. To illuminate the structural basis of AKR1C3 inhibition, we also report the crystal structure of the AKR1C3·NADP(+)·2 complex, which shows that compound 2 forms a unique double-decker structure with AKR1C3., Entry 1: Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C3 catalyzes the synthesis of active androgens that promote the progression of prostate cancer. AKR1C3 also contributes to androgen-independent cell proliferation and survival through the metabolism of prostaglandins and reactive aldehydes. Because of its elevation in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissues, AKR1C3 is a promising therapeutic target for CRPC. In this study, we found a novel potent AKR1C3 inhibitor, <i>N</i>-(4-fluorophenyl)-8-hydroxy-2-imino-2<i>H</i>-chromene-3-carboxamide (<b>2d</b>), and synthesized its derivatives with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 25-56 nM and >220-fold selectivity over other AKRs (1C1, 1C2, and 1C4). The structural factors for the inhibitory potency were elucidated by crystallographic study of AKR1C3 complexes with <b>2j</b> and <b>2l</b>. The inhibitors suppressed proliferation of prostate cancer 22Rv1 and PC3 cells through both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms. Additionally, <b>2j</b> and <b>2l</b> prevented prostate tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, the inhibitors significantly augmented apoptotic cell death induced by anti-CRPC drugs (abiraterone or enzalutamide)., Entry 2: Human aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is known as a hormone activity regulator and prostaglandin F (PGF) synthase that regulates the occupancy of hormone receptors and cell proliferation.

Here, we briefly review the physiological and pathological function of AKR1C3 and then summarize the recent development of selective AKR1C3 inhibitors.

AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., Entry 4: The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in the maintenance of muscle and bone and the support of male sexual-related functions, as well as in the progression of prostate cancer.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,CCS(=O)(=O)Nc1cccc(-c2cc(=O)n(-c3ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c3)nc2C)c1,C19H17Cl2N3O3S,CHEMBL2397334,2650.0,6260.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1805.0,2650.0,4455.0,4455.0,6260.0,3.648847708,3.648847708,3.423245874,5.351152292,5.351152292,5.576754126,2,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,2650.0,2650.0,2650.0,2650.0,5.576754126063192,5.576754126063192,5.576754126063192,5.576754126063192,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

As resistance to clinically used anti-AR drugs remains a major challenge for the treatment of advanced PCa, there is a pressing need for new anti-AR therapeutic avenues. In this study, we identified a binding site on the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the receptor and utilized virtual screening to discover a set of micromolar hits for the target. Through further exploration of the most potent hit (1), a structural analogue (6) was identified demonstrating 10-fold improved anti-AR potency. Further optimization resulted in a more potent synthetic analogue (25) with anti-AR potency comparable to a newly FDA-approved drug Enzalutamide. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the developed inhibitors do interact with the intended target site. Importantly, the AR DBD inhibitors could effectively inhibit the growth of Enzalutamide-resistant cells as well as block the transcriptional activity of constitutively active AR splice variants, such as V7.",,Cc1sc(N2CCOCC2)nc1-c1ccccc1,C14H16N2OS,CHEMBL3323503,1460.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1460.0,1460.0,1460.0,1460.0,3.164352856,3.164352856,3.164352856,5.835647144,5.835647144,5.835647144,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,1460.0,1460.0,1460.0,1460.0,5.835647144215563,5.835647144215563,5.835647144215563,5.835647144215563,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,Cc1c(N2C3CCC2CC(C)(O)C3)ccc(C#N)c1Cl,C16H19ClN2O,CHEMBL3410856,1.0,2.11,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.523259018,1.0,1.74,2.11,2.11,0.240549248,0.324282455,0.0,8.759450752,8.675717545,9.0,3,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Furthermore, under AR gene amplification or mutation conditions they demonstrate agonist activity and fail to inhibit AR, causing relapse into castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Discovery of new scaffolds distinct from the 4-cyano/nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group common to currently used antiandrogens is urgently needed to avoid cross-resistance with these compounds. In this study, a series of twenty-nine 7-substituted umbelliferone derivatives was prepared and their antiproliferative activities were evaluated. The most active compound 7a demonstrated submicromolar inhibitory activity in the human prostate cancer cell line (22Rv1); IC50=0.93 μM which represents a 50 fold improvement over the clinical antiandrogen bicalutamide (IC50=46 μM) and a more than 30 fold improvement over enzalutamide (IC50=32 μM).

PR plays key roles in various physiological systems, including the female reproductive system, and PR antagonists are candidates for clinical treatment of multiple diseases, including uterine leiomyoma, endometriosis, breast cancer, and some psychiatric disorders. We found that the benzenesulfonanilide skeleton functions as a novel scaffold for PR antagonists, and we adopted 3-chlorobenzenesulfonyl derivative 20a as a lead compound for structural development. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-trifluoromethyl derivative 32 exhibited the most potent PR-antagonistic activity, with high binding affinity for PR and selectivity over androgen receptor (AR). It is structurally distinct from other nonsteroidal PR antagonists, including cyanopyrrole derivatives, and further modification is expected to afford novel selective PR modulators.",,O=S(=O)(Nc1ccc(Oc2ccccc2)cc1)c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1,C19H14F3NO3S,CHEMBL3927163,5300.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,5300.0,5300.0,5300.0,5300.0,3.72427587,3.72427587,3.72427587,5.27572413,5.27572413,5.27572413,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,5300.0,5300.0,5300.0,5300.0,5.275724130399211,5.275724130399211,5.275724130399211,5.275724130399211,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

It has been stipulated that the lack of response and the development of secondary resistance to these drugs may be due to the presence of AR splice variants. HDAC6 has a role in regulating the androgen receptor (AR) by modulating heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) acetylation, which controls the nuclear localization and activation of the AR in androgen-dependent and independent scenarios. With dual-acting AR-HDAC6 inhibitors it should be possible to target patients who don't respond to enzalutamide. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of dual-acting compounds which target AR and are also specific towards HDAC6. Our efforts led to compound 10 which was found to have potent dual activity (HDAC6 IC50=0.0356μM and AR binding IC50=<0.03μM). Compound 10 was further evaluated for antagonist and other cell-based activities, in vitro stability and pharmacokinetics., Entry 1: The combination of androgen receptor antagonists with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) has been shown to be more effective than antiandrogens alone in halting growth of prostate cancer cell lines. Here we have designed, synthesized and assessed a series of antiandrogen/HDACi hybrids by combining structural features of enzalutamide with either SAHA or entinostat. The hybrids are demonstrated to maintain bifunctionality using a fluorometric HDAC assay and a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) antiandrogen assay. Antiproliferative assays showed that hybrids bearing o-aminoanilide-based HDACi motifs outperformed hydroxamic acid based HDACi's. The hybrids demonstrated selectivity for epithelial cell lines vs. stromal cell lines, suggesting a potentially useful therapeutic window., ",,CC1(C)C(=O)N(c2ccc(C#N)c(C(F)(F)F)c2)C(=S)N1c1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2N)c(F)c1,C26H19F4N5O2S,CHEMBL3955013,330.0,1700.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,685.0,330.0,1015.0,1015.0,1700.0,3.006466042,3.006466042,2.51851394,5.993533958,5.993533958,6.48148606,2,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,1700.0,1700.0,1700.0,1700.0,5.769551078621726,5.769551078621726,5.769551078621726,5.769551078621726,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

New Opportunities for the Development of Potent and Selective Ligands without Off-Target Side Effects.,PUBLICATION,"Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists are used for treatment of a range of human diseases, but they present challenging issues of complex chemical synthesis, undesirable physical properties, and poor selectivity along with unwanted side effects. Therefore, there is a great interest in the discovery of non-steroidal ligands able to bind to the ligand-binding domain of the MR and recruit different co-regulators to produce tissue-specific therapeutic effects. Several academic groups and pharmaceutical companies have been developing a series of non-steroidal ligands that consist of different chemical scaffolds, yielding MR antagonists currently evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of congestive heart failure, hypertension, or diabetic nephropathy. The main focus of this Perspective is to review the reported structure-activity relationships of the different series of compounds, as well as the structural studies that contribute to a better understanding of the receptor active site and are also helpful for optimization processes.",,CCOc1ncc(C)c2c1[C@H](c1ccc(C#N)cc1OC)C(C#N)=C(C)N2,C21H20N4O2,CHEMBL4096901,2400.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2400.0,2400.0,2400.0,2400.0,3.380211242,3.380211242,3.380211242,5.619788758,5.619788758,5.619788758,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,2400.0,2400.0,2400.0,2400.0,5.619788758288394,5.619788758288394,5.619788758288394,5.619788758288394,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Among the synthesized compounds, 37, 40, and 46 exhibited very potent PR antagonistic activity with high selectivity for PR over other nuclear receptors.

However, this series of aryl hydantoins produced antiandrogenic side effects in the host, a not unexpected outcome given their close structural similarity to the antiandrogenic drug nilutamide. Building on the known SAR of this compound series, we now describe a number of analogs of 1 designed to maximize structural diversity guided by incorporation of substructures and functional groups known to diminish ligand-androgen receptor interactions. These analogs had calculated polar surface area (PSA), measured LogD, aqueous kinetic solubility, and estimated plasma protein binding values in ranges predictive of good ADME profiles. The principal SAR insight was that the hydantoin core of 1 is required for high antischistosomal activity. We identified several compounds with high antischistosomal efficacy that were less antiandrogenic than 1. These data provide direction for the ongoing optimization of antischistosomal hydantoins.",,CC1(C)NC(=O)N(c2ccc(F)c(C(F)(F)F)c2)C1=O,C12H10F4N2O2,CHEMBL4465426,4400.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,4400.0,4400.0,4400.0,4400.0,3.643452676,3.643452676,3.643452676,5.356547324,5.356547324,5.356547324,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,4400.0,4400.0,4400.0,4400.0,5.356547323513812,5.356547323513812,5.356547323513812,5.356547323513812,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

The focus of drug discovery in NRs has hitherto been on identifying ligands that bind to the canonical ligand binding pockets of the C-terminal ligand binding domains (LBDs). Due to the development of drug resistance and selectivity concerns, there has been considerable interest in exploring other, non-canonical ligand binding sites. Unfortunately, the potencies of compounds binding at other sites have generally not been sufficient for clinical development. However, the situation has changed dramatically over the last 3years, as compounds with sufficient potency have been reported for several NR targets. Here we review recent developments in this area from a medicinal chemistry point of view in the hope of stimulating further interest in this area of research.",,c1ccc2c(c1)CC(c1c[nH]c3ccccc13)N2,C16H14N2,CHEMBL4528089,310.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,310.0,310.0,310.0,310.0,2.491361694,2.491361694,2.491361694,6.508638306,6.508638306,6.508638306,1,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,310.0,310.0,310.0,310.0,6.508638306165727,6.508638306165727,6.508638306165727,6.508638306165727,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

However, this series of aryl hydantoins produced antiandrogenic side effects in the host, a not unexpected outcome given their close structural similarity to the antiandrogenic drug nilutamide. Building on the known SAR of this compound series, we now describe a number of analogs of 1 designed to maximize structural diversity guided by incorporation of substructures and functional groups known to diminish ligand-androgen receptor interactions. These analogs had calculated polar surface area (PSA), measured LogD, aqueous kinetic solubility, and estimated plasma protein binding values in ranges predictive of good ADME profiles. The principal SAR insight was that the hydantoin core of 1 is required for high antischistosomal activity. We identified several compounds with high antischistosomal efficacy that were less antiandrogenic than 1. These data provide direction for the ongoing optimization of antischistosomal hydantoins.",,CC(C)(NC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)c(C(F)(F)F)c1)C(=O)O,C12H12F4N2O3,CHEMBL4572306,3100.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,3100.0,3100.0,3100.0,3100.0,3.491361694,3.491361694,3.491361694,5.508638306,5.508638306,5.508638306,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,3100.0,3100.0,3100.0,3100.0,5.508638306165727,5.508638306165727,5.508638306165727,5.508638306165727,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

However, this series of aryl hydantoins produced antiandrogenic side effects in the host, a not unexpected outcome given their close structural similarity to the antiandrogenic drug nilutamide. Building on the known SAR of this compound series, we now describe a number of analogs of 1 designed to maximize structural diversity guided by incorporation of substructures and functional groups known to diminish ligand-androgen receptor interactions. These analogs had calculated polar surface area (PSA), measured LogD, aqueous kinetic solubility, and estimated plasma protein binding values in ranges predictive of good ADME profiles. The principal SAR insight was that the hydantoin core of 1 is required for high antischistosomal activity. We identified several compounds with high antischistosomal efficacy that were less antiandrogenic than 1. These data provide direction for the ongoing optimization of antischistosomal hydantoins.",,CC1(C)C(=O)N(c2ccc(F)c(C(F)(F)F)c2)C(=O)N1CC#N,C14H11F4N3O2,CHEMBL4758277,290.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,290.0,290.0,290.0,290.0,2.462397998,2.462397998,2.462397998,6.537602002,6.537602002,6.537602002,1,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,290.0,290.0,290.0,290.0,6.537602002101044,6.537602002101044,6.537602002101044,6.537602002101044,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

The second-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide (ENZa) can prolong survival time for patients with mCRPC. However, the overexpression of glucocorticoids receptor (GR) in mCRPC cells causes the resistance of antiandrogen and leads to the failure of androgen receptor (AR) targeting therapy. Herein, based on the chemical structures of antiandrogen and crystal structure of GR, we set up to develop GR/AR (GR and AR) dual antagonist by virtual screening and biological evaluation. We identified Z19 as a dual AR/GR antagonist. Z19 inhibited the transcription activity of both AR and GR, reducing both protein and mRNA level of the downstream proteins of GR and AR signaling, and provided a potential lead compound for the development of novel treatment agents of prostate cancer. Our work demonstrates that rational drug design is an efficient strategy in development of the GR/AR dual antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer.",,CCOC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cccc(S(=O)(=O)N3CCCc4ccccc43)c2)s1,C23H22N2O5S2,CHEMBL4778550,2030.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2030.0,2030.0,2030.0,2030.0,3.307496038,3.307496038,3.307496038,5.692503962,5.692503962,5.692503962,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,2030.0,2030.0,2030.0,2030.0,5.692503962086787,5.692503962086787,5.692503962086787,5.692503962086787,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Further assays indicated that AT2 was capable of effectively inhibiting the transcriptional function of AR and blocking the nuclear translocation of AR like the second-generation AR antagonists. The antagonists discovered in this study may be served as the promising lead compounds for the development of AR-driven PCa therapeutics.",,Clc1ccc(C2Nc3ccc4ccccc4c3C3C4CCC(C4)C23)cc1,C24H22ClN,CHEMBL4782786,7450.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,7450.0,7450.0,7450.0,7450.0,3.872156273,3.872156273,3.872156273,5.127843727,5.127843727,5.127843727,1,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,7450.0,7450.0,7450.0,7450.0,5.127843727251707,5.127843727251707,5.127843727251707,5.127843727251707,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

However, this series of aryl hydantoins produced antiandrogenic side effects in the host, a not unexpected outcome given their close structural similarity to the antiandrogenic drug nilutamide. Building on the known SAR of this compound series, we now describe a number of analogs of 1 designed to maximize structural diversity guided by incorporation of substructures and functional groups known to diminish ligand-androgen receptor interactions. These analogs had calculated polar surface area (PSA), measured LogD, aqueous kinetic solubility, and estimated plasma protein binding values in ranges predictive of good ADME profiles. The principal SAR insight was that the hydantoin core of 1 is required for high antischistosomal activity. We identified several compounds with high antischistosomal efficacy that were less antiandrogenic than 1.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,CC(C)NC(=O)c1cccc2nc(-c3cn(COP(=O)([O-])[O-])c4c(F)c(F)c(F)cc34)ccc12.[Na+].[Na+],C22H17F3N3Na2O5P,CHEMBL4848581,660.0,660.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,660.0,660.0,660.0,660.0,2.819543936,2.819543936,2.819543936,6.180456064,6.180456064,6.180456064,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,660.0,660.0,660.0,660.0,6.180456064458132,6.180456064458132,6.180456064458132,6.180456064458132,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,IC50

Analogues missing the nonchlorinated methyl groups of the leucine side chains (C-1 and C-17) are just as active and in some cases more active than the natural products. Analogues with the natural <i>R</i> configuration at C-10 and the unnatural <i>R</i> configuration at C-4 are most potent. Replacing the natural propionamide N-terminus cap with the more sterically hindered pivaloylamide N-terminus cap leads to enhanced potency. The tetramic acid fragment and the methyl ether on the tetramic acid fragment are essential for activity. The SAR optimized analogue <b>76</b> is more selective, easier to synthesize, more potent, and presumed to be more resistant to proteolysis than the natural sintokamides., ",,CCC(=O)N[C@H](C[C@H](C)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)C(=O)N1C(=O)C=C(OC)[C@@H]1C[C@H](C)C(Cl)Cl,C18H25Cl5N2O4,CHEMBL4852950,6500.0,14000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3750.0,6500.0,10250.0,10250.0,14000.0,4.010723865,4.010723865,3.812913357,4.989276135,4.989276135,5.187086643,2,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,6500.0,6500.0,6500.0,6500.0,5.187086643357144,5.187086643357144,5.187086643357144,5.187086643357144,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,IC50

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized.
