We have developed a series of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands that retain the strong antiinflammatory activity of conventional glucocorticoids with reduced side effects. We present a compound, LGD5552, that binds the receptor efficiently and strongly represses inflammatory gene expression. LGD5552 bound to GR activates gene expression somewhat differently than glucocorticoids. It activates some genes with an efficacy similar to that of the glucocorticoids. However, other glucocorticoid-activated genes are not regulated by LGD5552. These differences may be because of the more efficient binding of corepressor in the presence of LGD5552, compared with glucocorticoid agonists. This class of nonsteroidal, GR-dependent antiinflammatory drugs may offer a safer alternative to steroidal glucocorticoids in the treatment of inflammatory disease.","InChI=1S/C28H26FNO3/c1-15-7-6-8-17(26(15)29)13-22-24-18(25-21(33-22)12-11-20(31)27(25)32-5)9-10-19-23(24)16(2)14-28(3,4)30-19/h6-14,30-31H,1-5H3/b22-13-",0.45,0.30,910.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target.","InChI=1S/C22H18ClN3O2/c1-13-18(8-7-17(12-25)21(13)23)26-22(14(2)27)20-10-9-19(28-20)16-5-3-15(11-24)4-6-16/h3-10,14,22,26-27H,1-2H3/t14-,22+/m0/s1",0.62,-0.94,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution at the C-10 position of the tetracyclic core with linear, two-atom appendages (OCH(3), OCF(2)H, NHMe, SMe, CH=CH(2), Ctbd1;CH, CH(2)OH) provided molecules of high affinity (K(i) = 2-8 nM) for the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) with limited cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors (PR, MR, AR, ER).

In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis.

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target.","InChI=1S/C17H15IN2O4/c1-16-6-11(21)17(2,24-16)13-12(16)14(22)20(15(13)23)9-4-3-8(7-19)10(18)5-9/h3-5,11-13,21H,6H2,1-2H3/t11-,12+,13-,16+,17-/m1/s1",0.53,0.06,2.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.

Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid.

Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs.

Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid.

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid.

This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

transcriptional activity of the human androgen receptor (hAR). The parent compound, 4-(trifluoromethyl)-2(1H)-pyrrolidino[3,2-g]quinolinone, displayed moderate interaction with hAR, but more substituted analogues, particularly 6,7-disubstituted compounds, were potent hAR agonists in vitro., Entry 1: A novel series of isoindoledione based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR). Co-crystallization of members of this family of inhibitors was successfully accomplished with the T877A AR LBD. A working model of how this class of compounds functions to antagonize the AR was created. Based on this model, it was proposed that expanding the bicyclic portion of the molecule should result in analogs which function as effective antagonists against a variety of AR isoforms. In contrast to what was predicted by the model, SAR around this new series was dictated by the aniline portion rather than the bicyclic portion of the molecule., Entry 2: A series of nonsteroidal human androgen receptor (hAR) antagonists based on 8-substituted 1,2-dihydro- and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2-dimethyl-6-trifluoromethylpyrido[3,2-g]quin olines was synthesized. Compounds in this series were tested for the ability to bind to hAR and inhibit hAR-dependent transcription in a mammalian cellular background., Entry 3: A novel series of isoindoledione based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR). SAR around this series revealed dramatic differences in binding and function in mutant variants (MT) of the AR as compared to the wild type (WT) receptor. Optimization of the aniline portion revealed substitution patterns, which yielded potent antagonist activity against the WT AR as well as the MT AR found in the LNCaP and PCa2b human prostate tumor cell lines., Entry 4: A novel series of isoindoledione based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR). SAR around this series revealed dramatic differences in binding and function in mutant variants (MT) of the AR as compared to the wild type (WT) receptor.

The ability of these compounds to act as antagonists to the androgen receptor was investigated and several were found to have potent activity in vitro., Entry 6: A novel series of isoindoledione based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR). Co-crystallization of members of this family of inhibitors was successfully accomplished with the T877A AR LBD. A working model of how this class of compounds functions to antagonize the AR was created.

In contrast to what was predicted by the model, SAR around this new series was dictated by the aniline portion rather than the bicyclic portion of the molecule., Entry 7: A novel series of trans-N-aryl-2,5-dimethylpiperazine-1-carboxamide derivatives was synthesized and their androgen receptor (AR) antagonist activities and in vivo antiandrogenic effects were evaluated. Pharmacological assays indicated that compound 33 was a potent AR antagonist, and subsequent optical resolution provided (+)-(2R,5S)-4-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2,5-dimethyl-N-[6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl]piperazine-1-carboxamide (33a, YM580) which exhibited the most potent antiandrogenic activity. Unlike bicalutamide, compound 33a decreased the weight of rat ventral prostate in a dose-dependent manner (ED(50) = 2.2 mg/kg/day), and induced the maximum antiandrogenic effect, comparable to that of surgical castration, without significantly affecting serum testosterone levels. Compound 33a is a promising clinical candidate for prostate cancer monotherapy., Entry 8: A series of alkylamino-2-quinolinone compounds (3) was discovered as androgen receptor modulators based on an early linear tricyclic quinoline pharmacophore (1). The series demonstrated selective high binding affinity to androgen receptor and potent receptor modulating activities in the cotransfection assays., Entry 9: A new nonsteroidal antiandrogenic pharmacophore has been discovered using cell-based cotransfection assays with human androgen receptor (hAR). This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases., Entry 10: A novel series of [2.2.1]-oxabicyclo imide-based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor. Molecular modeling and iterative drug design were applied to optimize this series. The lead compound [3aS-(3aalpha,4beta,5beta,7beta,7aalpha)]-4-(octahydro-5-hydroxy-4,7-dimethyl-1,3-dioxo-4,7-epoxy-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-2-iodobenzonitrile was shown to have potent in vivo efficacy after oral dosing in the CWR22 human prostate tumor xenograph model., Entry 11: A novel oxachrysenone series (2) of nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM) was developed based on the 6-aryl-2-quinolinones (1). Synthesis and preliminary SAR results based on in vitro assays are discussed. In the cotransfection assay, lead compound 5d showed AR agonist activity more potent than dihydrotestosterone (DHT), whereas compound 17b was a potent antagonist similar to bicalutamide., Entry 12: Modification on a lead series of [1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones at the 2-position led to selective androgen receptor modulators with improved in vivo activity. The most potent analog (-)-33a exhibited full maintenance of levator ani muscle at 3mg/kg and reduced activity on ventral prostate weight in a 2-week orally-dosed and orchidectomized rat maintenance assay., Entry 13: A novel series of 4-[3,5-dioxo-11-oxa-4,9-diazatricyclo[5.3.1.0(2,6)]undec-4-yl]-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitriles has been synthesized. The ability of these compounds to act as antagonists of the androgen receptor was investigated and several were found to have potent activity in vitro and in vivo., Entry 14: A series of novel highly active androgen receptor (AR) antagonists containing spiro-4-(5-oxo-3-phenyl-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile core was designed based on the SAR studies available from the reported AR antagonists and in silico modeling. Within the series, compound (R)-6 (ONC1-13B) and its related analogues, including its active N-dealkylated metabolite, were found to be the most potent molecules with the target activity (IC50, androgen-sensitive human PCa LNCaP cells) in the range of 59-80 nM (inhibition of PSA production). The disclosed hits were at least two times more active than bicalutamide, nilutamide and enzalutamide within the performed assay. Several compounds were classified as partial agonists. Hit-compounds demonstrated benefit pharmacokinetic profiles in rats. Comparative SAR and 3D molecular docking studies were performed for the hit compounds elucidating the observed differences in the binding potency., Entry 15: BMS-641988 (23) is a novel, nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist designed for the treatment of prostate cancer. The compound has high binding affinity for the AR and acts as a functional antagonist in vitro. BMS-641988 is efficacious in multiple human prostate cancer xenograft models, including CWR22-BMSLD1 where it displays superior efficacy relative to bicalutamide. Based on its promising preclinical profile, BMS-641988 was selected for clinical development., Entry 16: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., ","InChI=1S/C18H14F4N2O4S/c1-17(26,10-29(27,28)14-6-3-12(19)4-7-14)16(25)24-13-5-2-11(9-23)15(8-13)18(20,21)22/h2-8,26H,10H2,1H3,(H,24,25)",0.56,-1.64,11.0,19.0,35.0,35.0,64.0,64.0,64.0,64.0,64.0,65.0,82.0,117.0,117.0,151.0,151.0,151.0,160.2

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.

In pursuit of this, we have discovered a series of novel androgen receptor modulators derived from 7H-[1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones. These compounds were synthesized and evaluated in competitive binding assays and an androgen receptor transcriptional activation assay. A number of compounds from the series demonstrated single-digit nanomolar agonist activity in vitro. In addition, lead compound (R)-16e was orally active in established rodent models that measure androgenic and anabolic properties of these agents. In this assay, (R)-16e demonstrated full efficacy in muscle and only partially stimulated the prostate at 100 mg/kg.

In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis.

2(1H)-pyrrolidino[3,2-g]quinolinones was prepared and tested for the ability to modulate the transcriptional activity of the human androgen receptor (hAR). The parent compound, 4-(trifluoromethyl)-2(1H)-pyrrolidino[3,2-g]quinolinone, displayed moderate interaction with hAR, but more substituted analogues, particularly 6,7-disubstituted compounds, were potent hAR agonists in vitro., Entry 1: A series of human androgen receptor (hAR) agonists based on 4-alkyl-; 4,4-dialkyl-; and 3,4-dialkyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-pyridono[5,6-g]quinoline was synthesized and evaluated in competitive receptor binding assays and an androgen receptor cotransfection assay in a mammalian cell background. A number of compounds in this series demonstrated activity equal to or better than dihydrotestosterone in both assays and represent a novel class of compounds for use in androgen replacement therapy., Entry 2: The androgen receptor is a member of the extended family of nuclear receptors and is widely distributed throughout the body. Androgen therapy is used to compensate for low levels of the natural hormones testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone and consists of administration of T, prodrugs thereof, or synthetic androgens. However, currently available androgens have many drawbacks. We identified 6-dialkylamino-4-trifluoromethylquinolin-2(1H)-ones as orally available tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators., Entry 3: A novel, N-aryl-bicyclohydantoin selective androgen receptor modulator scaffold was discovered through structure-guided modifications of androgen receptor antagonists. A prototype compound (7R,7aS)-10b from this series is a potent and highly tissue-selective agonist of the androgen receptor. After oral dosing in a rat atrophied levator ani muscle model, (7R,7aS)-10b demonstrated efficacy at restoring levator ani muscle mass to that of intact controls and exhibited >50-fold selectivity for muscle over prostate., Entry 4: New nonsteroidal human androgen receptor (hAR) agonists were developed from an hAR antagonist pharmacophore, 2(1H)-piperidino[3,2-g]quinolinone. (+/-)-trans-7,8-Diethyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2(H)-piperidino-[3,2-g]quinoli none was synthesized and demonstrated potent hAR agonist activity (EC50=3 nM) in the cell-based cotransfection assay and high binding affinity (Ki=16 nM) in the competitive receptor binding assay., Entry 5: A series of alkylamino-2-quinolinone compounds (3) was discovered as androgen receptor modulators based on an early linear tricyclic quinoline pharmacophore (1). The series demonstrated selective high binding affinity to androgen receptor and potent receptor modulating activities in the cotransfection assays., Entry 6: Recent interest in orally available androgens has fueled the search for new androgens for use in hormone replacement therapy and as anabolic agents. In pursuit of this, we have discovered a series of novel androgen receptor modulators derived from 7H-[1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones. These compounds were synthesized and evaluated in competitive binding assays and an androgen receptor transcriptional activation assay. A number of compounds from the series demonstrated single-digit nanomolar agonist activity in vitro. In addition, lead compound (R)-16e was orally active in established rodent models that measure androgenic and anabolic properties of these agents. In this assay, (R)-16e demonstrated full efficacy in muscle and only partially stimulated the prostate at 100 mg/kg. These data suggest that these compounds may be utilized as selective androgen receptor modulators or SARMs. This series represents a novel class of compounds for use in androgen replacement therapy., Entry 7: A series of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) with a wide spectrum of receptor modulating activities was developed based on optimization of the 4-substituted 6-bisalkylamino-2-quinolinones (3). Significance of the trifluoromethyl group on the side chains and its interactions with amino acid residues within the androgen receptor (AR) ligand binding domain are discussed. A representative analog (9) was tested orally in a rodent model of hypogonadism and demonstrated desirable tissue selectivity., Entry 8: The androgen receptor is a ligand inducible transcription factor that is involved in a broad range of physiological functions. Here we describe the discovery of a new class of orally available selective androgen receptor modulators. The lead compound, 6-[(2R,5R)-2-methyl-5-((R)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl]-4-trifluoromethylquinolin-2(1H)-one (6a), showed excellent anabolic activity in muscle with reduced effect on the prostate in a rat model of hypogonadism. The compound also improved bone strength in a rat model of post-menopausal osteoporosis., Entry 9: A novel oxachrysenone series (2) of nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM) was developed based on the 6-aryl-2-quinolinones (1). Synthesis and preliminary SAR results based on in vitro assays are discussed. In the cotransfection assay, lead compound 5d showed AR agonist activity more potent than dihydrotestosterone (DHT), whereas compound 17b was a potent antagonist similar to bicalutamide., Entry 10: Modification on a lead series of [1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones at the 2-position led to selective androgen receptor modulators with improved in vivo activity. The most potent analog (-)-33a exhibited full maintenance of levator ani muscle at 3mg/kg and reduced activity on ventral prostate weight in a 2-week orally-dosed and orchidectomized rat maintenance assay., Entry 11: A novel class of non-steroidal progesterone receptor antagonists with aromatic beta-amino-ketone scaffold have been synthesized and characterized with high binding affinity and great selectivity for the cognate receptors. Among them, compound 22 was shown to be the most potent progesterone receptor antagonist in cotransfection assay and a murine model of ligand-induced decidualization., Entry 12: This report describes the discovery of RAD140, a potent, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM).

Further, compound 22 had potent binding affinity for T877A mutated AR, and dose-dependently inhibited the testosterone-induced production of prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP cells bearing T877A AR.","InChI=1S/C25H35N3O/c1-19-13-20(2)15-22(14-19)28(17-21-9-5-4-6-10-21)23-16-24(26(3)18-23)25(29)27-11-7-8-12-27/h13-16,18,21H,4-12,17H2,1-3H3",0.66,-1.00,490.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution at the C-10 position of the tetracyclic core with linear, two-atom appendages (OCH(3), OCF(2)H, NHMe, SMe, CH=CH(2), Ctbd1;CH, CH(2)OH) provided molecules of high affinity (K(i) = 2-8 nM) for the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) with limited cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors (PR, MR, AR, ER). Optimal analogues showed slightly less potent but highly efficacious E-selectin repression with reduced levels of GRE activation efficacy in reporter gene assays relative to prednisolone. Preliminary SAR of analogues containing substitution at the C-9 and C-10 positions identified the 9-OH, 10-OMe analogue 50 and the 9-OH, 10-Cl analogue 58 as compounds that demonstrated potent, GR-mediated inhibition in a conconavalin A stimulated T-cell proliferation assay in both rodent and human whole blood monocytes. When evaluated for their in vivo effects in carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats, 50, 58, and 10-OCF(2)H analogue 35 showed dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects (50, ED(50) = 16 mg/kg; 58, ED(50) = 15 mg/kg; 35, ED(50) = 21 mg/kg vs ED(50) = 15 mg/kg for 18 and ED(50) = 4 mg/kg for prednisolone)., Entry 1: A novel class of functional ligands for the human glucocorticoid receptor is described. Substituents in the C-10 position of the tetracyclic core are essential for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) selectivity versus other steroid receptors. The C-5 position is derivatized with meta-substituted aromatic groups, resulting in analogues with a high affinity for GR (K(i) = 2.4-9.3 nM) and functional activity comparable to prednisolone in reporter gene assays of glucocorticoid-mediated gene transcription. The biological activity of these novel quinolines was also prednisolone-equivalent in whole cell assays of glucocorticoid function, and compound 13 was similar to prednisolone (po ED(50) = 2.8 mpk for 13 vs ED(50) = 1.2 mpk for prednisolone) in a rodent model of asthma (sephadex-induced eosinophil influx)., Entry 2: The structural basis of the pharmacology enabling the use of glucocorticoids as reliable treatments for inflammation and autoimmune diseases has been augmented with a new group of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands. Compound 10, the archetype of a new family of dibenzoxepane and dibenzosuberane sulfonamides, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with selectivity for the GR versus other steroid receptors and a differentiated gene expression profile versus clinical glucocorticoids (lower GR transactivation with comparable transrepression). A stereospecific synthesis of this chiral molecule provides the unique topology needed for biological activity and structural biology. In vivo activity of 10 in acute and chronic models of inflammation is equivalent to prednisolone. The crystal structure of compound 10 within the GR ligand binding domain (LBD) unveils a novel binding conformation distinct from the classic model adopted by cognate ligands. The overall conformation of the GR LBD/10 complex provides a new basis for binding, selectivity, and anti-inflammatory activity and a path for further insights into structure-based ligand design., ","InChI=1S/C21H28O5/c1-19-7-5-13(23)9-12(19)3-4-14-15-6-8-21(26,17(25)11-22)20(15,2)10-16(24)18(14)19/h5,7,9,14-16,18,22,24,26H,3-4,6,8,10-11H2,1-2H3/t14-,15-,16-,18+,19-,20-,21-/m0/s1",0.69,2.57,2520.0,2760.0,2762.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs. Design, synthesis, and biological activity of novel SARDs that could potentially be used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of PCs including castration-resistant, Enz-R, and/or AR SV-dependent advanced PCs that are often untreatable with known hormone therapies are discussed.","InChI=1S/C19H15ClFN3O2/c1-19(26,11-24-7-6-12-8-14(21)3-5-17(12)24)18(25)23-15-4-2-13(10-22)16(20)9-15/h2-9,26H,11H2,1H3,(H,23,25)/t19-/m0/s1",0.73,-1.84,253.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid.

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid.

Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases.","InChI=1S/C17H19F3N2O/c1-9-8-16(2,3)21-13-7-14-11(5-10(9)13)12(17(18,19)20)6-15(23)22(14)4/h5-7,9,21H,8H2,1-4H3",0.79,-0.21,46.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In pursuit of this, we have discovered a series of novel androgen receptor modulators derived from 7H-[1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones. These compounds were synthesized and evaluated in competitive binding assays and an androgen receptor transcriptional activation assay. A number of compounds from the series demonstrated single-digit nanomolar agonist activity in vitro.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ","InChI=1S/C15H12F6N2O2/c1-7-5-25-12-4-10-8(2-11(12)23(7)6-14(16,17)18)9(15(19,20)21)3-13(24)22-10/h2-4,7H,5-6H2,1H3,(H,22,24)/t7-/m0/s1",0.78,-0.64,0.9,5.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid.

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., Entry 5: The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in the maintenance of muscle and bone and the support of male sexual-related functions, as well as in the progression of prostate cancer. Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.

Compound 10, the archetype of a new family of dibenzoxepane and dibenzosuberane sulfonamides, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with selectivity for the GR versus other steroid receptors and a differentiated gene expression profile versus clinical glucocorticoids (lower GR transactivation with comparable transrepression). A stereospecific synthesis of this chiral molecule provides the unique topology needed for biological activity and structural biology. In vivo activity of 10 in acute and chronic models of inflammation is equivalent to prednisolone. The crystal structure of compound 10 within the GR ligand binding domain (LBD) unveils a novel binding conformation distinct from the classic model adopted by cognate ligands. The overall conformation of the GR LBD/10 complex provides a new basis for binding, selectivity, and anti-inflammatory activity and a path for further insights into structure-based ligand design.","InChI=1S/C22H29FO5/c1-12-8-16-15-5-4-13-9-14(25)6-7-19(13,2)21(15,23)17(26)10-20(16,3)22(12,28)18(27)11-24/h6-7,9,12,15-17,24,26,28H,4-5,8,10-11H2,1-3H3/t12-,15+,16+,17+,19+,20+,21+,22+/m1/s1",0.67,2.21,1410.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid. This optimization led to the identification of A-348441, which reduces glucose levels and improves lipid profiles in an animal model of diabetes., Entry 1: A novel class of nonsteroidal progesterone receptor antagonists has been synthesized and was shown to exhibit moderate binding affinity for hPR-A, the ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of human progesterone receptor (hPR) in cell-based assays, and anti-progestational activity in a murine model. Cyclocymopol monomethyl ether, a component of the marine alga Cymopolia barbata was weakly active in random screening against PR. Investigations into the SAR surrounding the core of this natural product lead structure resulted in improved in vitro activity. In contrast to the cross-reactivity profiles observed with known steroidal antiprogestins, compounds of the general structural class described display a high degree of selectivity for the progesterone receptor and no functional activity on the glucocorticoid receptor., Entry 2: An approach to the computer-assisted, pharmacophore design of nonsteroidal templates for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that contained an element of pseudo-C2 symmetry was developed. The enatiomer of the initial design, 1Ra, and not the designed molecule, 1S, showed the desired ligand binding to the GR. The pseudo-C2 symmetry of the template allowed for rapid improvements in GR activity resulting in potent, selective, nonsteroidal GR antagonists, CP-394531 and CP-409069., Entry 3: A new nonsteroidal antiandrogenic pharmacophore has been discovered using cell-based cotransfection assays with human androgen receptor (hAR). This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases., Entry 4: A novel class of non-steroidal progesterone receptor antagonists with aromatic beta-amino-ketone scaffold have been synthesized and characterized with high binding affinity and great selectivity for the cognate receptors. Among them, compound 22 was shown to be the most potent progesterone receptor antagonist in cotransfection assay and a murine model of ligand-induced decidualization., Entry 5: To further elucidate the structural activity correlation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism, the crystal structure of the GR ligand-binding domain (GR LBD) complex with a nonsteroidal antagonist, compound 8, was determined. This novel indole sulfonamide shows in vitro activity comparable to known GR antagonists such as mifepristone, and notably, this molecule lowers LDL (-74%) and raises HDL (+73%) in a hamster model of dyslipidemia. This is the first reported crystal structure of the GR LBD bound to a nonsteroidal antagonist, and this article provides additional elements for the design and pharmacology of clinically relevant nonsteroidal GR antagonists that may have greater selectivity and fewer side effects than their steroidal counterparts., ","InChI=1S/C29H35NO2/c1-5-15-29(32)16-14-26-24-12-8-20-17-22(31)11-13-23(20)27(24)25(18-28(26,29)2)19-6-9-21(10-7-19)30(3)4/h6-7,9-10,17,24-26,32H,8,11-14,16,18H2,1-4H3/t24-,25+,26-,28-,29-/m0/s1",0.64,1.23,0.65,4.6,5.95,8.4,10.6,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution at the C-10 position of the tetracyclic core with linear, two-atom appendages (OCH(3), OCF(2)H, NHMe, SMe, CH=CH(2), Ctbd1;CH, CH(2)OH) provided molecules of high affinity (K(i) = 2-8 nM) for the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) with limited cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors (PR, MR, AR, ER).

Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

Compound 10, the archetype of a new family of dibenzoxepane and dibenzosuberane sulfonamides, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with selectivity for the GR versus other steroid receptors and a differentiated gene expression profile versus clinical glucocorticoids (lower GR transactivation with comparable transrepression). A stereospecific synthesis of this chiral molecule provides the unique topology needed for biological activity and structural biology. In vivo activity of 10 in acute and chronic models of inflammation is equivalent to prednisolone. The crystal structure of compound 10 within the GR ligand binding domain (LBD) unveils a novel binding conformation distinct from the classic model adopted by cognate ligands.

Within the series, compound (R)-6 (ONC1-13B) and its related analogues, including its active N-dealkylated metabolite, were found to be the most potent molecules with the target activity (IC50, androgen-sensitive human PCa LNCaP cells) in the range of 59-80 nM (inhibition of PSA production). The disclosed hits were at least two times more active than bicalutamide, nilutamide and enzalutamide within the performed assay. Several compounds were classified as partial agonists. Hit-compounds demonstrated benefit pharmacokinetic profiles in rats. Comparative SAR and 3D molecular docking studies were performed for the hit compounds elucidating the observed differences in the binding potency., Entry 1: In our effort to find small-molecule treatments of advanced prostate cancers (PCs), a novel series of indolyl and indolinyl propanamides (series II and III) were discovered as selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs). Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs. Design, synthesis, and biological activity of novel SARDs that could potentially be used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of PCs including castration-resistant, Enz-R, and/or AR SV-dependent advanced PCs that are often untreatable with known hormone therapies are discussed., Entry 2: 48 new drugs including 38 chemical entities (33 new chemical entities, 3 new diagnostic agents, and 2 payloads of antibody drug conjugates) and 10 biologics were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during 2019. These marketed new drugs represent privileged structures and novel action of mechanism, and thus can be served as leads to discover new drugs with the similar biological targets and improved therapeutic efficacy. This review aims to provide an overview regarding the synthetic approaches of 33 new chemical entities approved by the FDA in 2019 and their clinical applications., Entry 3: Prostate cancer is the most common carcinoma of the male urinary system in developed countries. Androgen deprivation therapy has been commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer for decades, but most patients will inevitably develop into more aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, novel strategies are urgent to address this resistance mechanism. In this review, we discussed some new strategies for targeting androgen receptors through degradation pathways as potential treatments for prostate cancer., Entry 4: Persistent androgen receptor (AR) activation drives therapeutic resistance to second-generation AR pathway inhibitors and contributes to the progression of advanced prostate cancer. One resistance mechanism is point mutations in the ligand binding domain of AR that can transform antagonists into agonists. The AR F877L mutation, identified in patients treated with enzalutamide or apalutamide, confers resistance to both enzalutamide and apalutamide. Compound <b>4</b> (JNJ-pan-AR) was identified as a pan-AR antagonist with potent activity against wild-type and clinically relevant AR mutations including F877L.

These models of the androgen receptor were based on the crystal structure of the highly homologous human progesterone receptor ligand binding domain. The homology modeled androgen receptor was refined using unrestrained multiple molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Key H-bonding partners with the 17-hydroxy group and 3-keto group of testosterone are Asn705 and Thr877, and Gln711 and Arg752, respectively. These models show the presence of a unique unoccupied cavity within the androgen receptor binding pocket which may be valuable in the development of novel selective androgen receptor ligands. A qualitative analysis of amino acid mutations within the hAR binding pocket that affect ligand binding are consistent with these androgen receptor models. In addition to testosterone, the binding modes of several hydroxyflutamide-like nonsteroidal ligands for the androgen receptor are investigated using flexible docking with FlexX followed by refinement of the initial complexes with molecular dynamics simulations. These docking studies indicate that Asn705 is an important determinant in binding hydroxyflutamide and its derivatives by participating in H-bond interactions with the alpha-hydroxy moiety of these ligands. In addition, the nitro functionality mimics the 3-keto group of the natural ligand testosterone and is involved in H-bonding interactions with Gln711 and Arg752. From these docking studies, we suggest a mechanism for the enantioselective binding of chiral hydroxyflutamide derivatives and expand upon the previously reported structure-activity relationship for hydroxyflutamide and its derivatives.","InChI=1S/C11H12BrF3N2O2/c1-10(19,5-12)9(18)17-6-2-3-8(16)7(4-6)11(13,14)15/h2-4,19H,5,16H2,1H3,(H,17,18)/t10-/m0/s1",0.58,-0.66,80.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid. This optimization led to the identification of A-348441, which reduces glucose levels and improves lipid profiles in an animal model of diabetes.","InChI=1S/C54H74N2O8/c1-7-54(63)23-21-42-39-15-11-33-26-36(57)14-16-38(33)48(39)40(30-52(42,54)4)32-9-12-35(13-10-32)56(6)25-24-55-50(62)64-45-28-34-27-37(58)20-22-51(34,3)44-29-46(59)53(5)41(17-18-43(53)49(44)45)31(2)8-19-47(60)61/h1,9-10,12-13,26,31,34,37,39-46,49,58-59,63H,8,11,14-25,27-30H2,2-6H3,(H,55,62)(H,60,61)/t31-,34+,37?,39+,40-,41-,42+,43+,44+,45-,46+,49+,51+,52+,53-,54+/m1/s1",0.15,1.47,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs.

Optimization of the aniline portion revealed substitution patterns, which yielded potent antagonist activity against the WT AR as well as the MT AR found in the LNCaP and PCa2b human prostate tumor cell lines., Entry 4: A novel series of isoindoledione based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR). Co-crystallization of members of this family of inhibitors was successfully accomplished with the T877A AR LBD. A working model of how this class of compounds functions to antagonize the AR was created. Based on this model, it was proposed that expanding the bicyclic portion of the molecule should result in analogs which function as effective antagonists against a variety of AR isoforms. In contrast to what was predicted by the model, SAR around this new series was dictated by the aniline portion rather than the bicyclic portion of the molecule., Entry 5: A new nonsteroidal antiandrogenic pharmacophore has been discovered using cell-based cotransfection assays with human androgen receptor (hAR). This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases., Entry 6: A novel series of [2.2.1]-oxabicyclo imide-based compounds were identified as potent antagonists of the androgen receptor. Molecular modeling and iterative drug design were applied to optimize this series. The lead compound [3aS-(3aalpha,4beta,5beta,7beta,7aalpha)]-4-(octahydro-5-hydroxy-4,7-dimethyl-1,3-dioxo-4,7-epoxy-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-2-iodobenzonitrile was shown to have potent in vivo efficacy after oral dosing in the CWR22 human prostate tumor xenograph model., Entry 7: Various 4-(anilino)pyrrole-2-carboxamides were designed and synthesized as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists without steroidal or anilide structure, based on our strategy for developing full antagonists of nuclear receptors. Introduction of a bulky N-alkyl group, such as a cyclohexylmethyl or benzyl group, increased the binding affinity for wild-type AR and the potency for growth inhibition of androgen-dependent SC-3 cells. Among the compounds obtained, N-[4-[(benzyl)(4-nitrophenyl)amino]-1-methylpyrrole-2-carbonyl]pyrrolidine (22) is as potent an AR antagonist as the typical anilide-type AR antagonists hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. Further, compound 22 had potent binding affinity for T877A mutated AR, and dose-dependently inhibited the testosterone-induced production of prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP cells bearing T877A AR., Entry 8: Various 4-(anilino)pyrrole-2-carboxamides were designed and synthesized as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists without steroidal or anilide structure, based on our strategy for developing full antagonists of nuclear receptors.

Cyclocymopol monomethyl ether, a component of the marine alga Cymopolia barbata was weakly active in random screening against PR. Investigations into the SAR surrounding the core of this natural product lead structure resulted in improved in vitro activity. In contrast to the cross-reactivity profiles observed with known steroidal antiprogestins, compounds of the general structural class described display a high degree of selectivity for the progesterone receptor and no functional activity on the glucocorticoid receptor.","InChI=1S/C20H25BrO3/c1-12-7-8-20(4,5)16(13(12)2)9-15-10-19(23-6)17(21)11-18(15)24-14(3)22/h7,10-11,16H,2,8-9H2,1,3-6H3/t16-/m1/s1",0.50,1.40,6387.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
