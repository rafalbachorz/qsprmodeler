All of these complexes retain a modest affinity for the androgen receptor. The N-substituted complexes show a weak or moderate antiproliferative effect (IC 50 around 68 microM) on hormone-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells, while the C(5)-substituted compounds exhibit toxicity levels 10 times higher (IC 50 around 5.4 microM). This strong antiproliferative effect is probably due to a structural effect linked to the aromatic character of the ferrocene rather than to its organometallic feature. In addition, it seems connected to a cytotoxic effect rather than an antihormonal one. These results open the way toward a new family of molecules that are active against both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent prostate cancer cells.","InChI=1S/C18H14F4N2O4S/c1-17(26,10-29(27,28)14-6-3-12(19)4-7-14)16(25)24-13-5-2-11(9-23)15(8-13)18(20,21)22/h2-8,26H,10H2,1H3,(H,24,25)/t17-/m0/s1",0.56,-1.64,0.29

Most of the synthesized compounds displayed moderate to satisfactory AR binding affinity and might lead to antagonist activity against AR. Among them, compound A16 exhibited the best AR binding affinity (85%) and degradation activity against AR. Due to the strong fluorescence properties of pomalidomide derivatives, B10 was found to be effectively internalized and visualized in LNCaP (AR + ) cells than PC-3 (AR-) cells. Moreover, the molecular docking of A16 with AR and the active site of DDB1-CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex provides guidance to design new PROTAC degrons targeting AR for prostate cancer therapy. These results represent a step toward the development of novel and improved AR PROTACs.","InChI=1S/C33H29F3N8O7S/c1-32(2)30(49)43(20-8-7-18(14-37)22(13-20)33(34,35)36)31(52)42(32)17-41-15-19(39-40-41)16-50-11-4-12-51-24-6-3-5-21-26(24)29(48)44(28(21)47)23-9-10-25(45)38-27(23)46/h3,5-8,13,15,23H,4,9-12,16-17H2,1-2H3,(H,38,45,46)",0.17,-1.17,39.21
