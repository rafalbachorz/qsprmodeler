In order to solve the problem of drug resistance in the treatment of prostate cancer, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTAC) was introduced into the design of anti-prostate cancer derivatives. In this work, we synthesized two series of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) containing the hydrophobic degrons with different linker, and then investigated the structure-activity relationships of these hybrid compounds. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to good activity against all the cancer cell lines selected. Among them, compound A9 displayed potent inhibitory activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cell line with IC values of 1.75 μM, as well as excellent AR degradation activity. Primary mechanism studies elucidated compound A9 arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induced a mild apoptotic response in LNCaP cells. Further study indicated that the degradation of AR was mediated through proteasome-mediated process. For all these reasons, compound A9 held promising potential as anti-proliferative agent for the development of highly efficient SARDs for drug-resistance prostate cancer therapies.","InChI=1S/C34H41F3N6O5S/c1-32(2)30(45)43(27-4-3-25(19-38)28(14-27)34(35,36)37)31(49)42(32)21-26-20-41(40-39-26)5-6-46-7-8-47-9-10-48-29(44)18-33-15-22-11-23(16-33)13-24(12-22)17-33/h3-4,14,20,22-24H,5-13,15-18,21H2,1-2H3",0.15,-1.28,35.09,,,,,,,,

The currently used drugs unfortunately possess very weak affinity for the human AR (hAR), thus indicating the need to develop new high-affinity steroidal antiandrogens. Our compounds are specially designed to impede repositioning of the mobile carboxyl-terminal helix 12, which blocks the ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) located in the AR ligand-binding domain (ARLBD). Using crystal structures of the hARLBD, we first found that H12 could be directly reached from the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) by a chain positioned on the C18 atom of an androgen steroid nucleus. A set of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone-derived molecules bearing various C18 chains were thus synthesized and tested for their capacity to bind hAR and act as antagonists. Although most of those having very high affinity for hAR were agonists, several very potent antagonists were obtained, confirming the structural importance of the C18 chain. To understand the role of the C18 chain in their agonistic/antagonistic properties, the structure of the hARLBD complexed with one of these agonists, EM5744, was determined at a 1.65-A resolution. We have identified new interactions involving Gln(738), Met(742), and His(874) that explain both the high affinity of this compound and the inability of its bulky chain to prevent the repositioning of H12. This structural information will be helpful to refine the structure of the chains placed on the C18 atom to obtain efficient H12-directed steroidal antiandrogens.","InChI=1S/C27H36F2O3/c1-26-8-6-21(30)14-18(26)2-3-22-23(26)7-9-27(24(22)4-5-25(27)31)10-11-32-16-17-12-19(28)15-20(29)13-17/h12-13,15,18,22-25,31H,2-11,14,16H2,1H3/t18-,22+,23-,24-,25-,26-,27+/m0/s1",0.58,1.36,525.0,,,,,,,,

Ganoderol B with 5alpha-reductase inhibitory activity and the ability to bind to androgen receptor (AR) can inhibit androgen-induced LNCaP cell growth and suppress regrowth of the ventral prostate induced by testosterone in rats. The down-regulation of AR signaling by ganoderol B provides an important mechanism for its anti-androgenic activity. In view of the fact that PSA (prostatic specific antigen, a well-accepted prognostic indicator of prostate cancer) is down-regulated, an important implication of this study is that ganoderol B intervention strategy aimed at toning down the amplitude of androgen signaling could be helpful in controlling morbidity of prostate cancer. In conclusion, our result suggests that ganoderol B might be useful in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) therapy through suppressing the function of androgen and its receptor.","InChI=1S/C30H48O2/c1-20(19-31)9-8-10-21(2)22-13-17-30(7)24-11-12-25-27(3,4)26(32)15-16-28(25,5)23(24)14-18-29(22,30)6/h9,11,14,21-22,25-26,31-32H,8,10,12-13,15-19H2,1-7H3/b20-9+/t21-,22-,25+,26+,28-,29-,30+/m1/s1",0.44,3.61,50.0,,,,,,,,

Unexpectedly, the effect of these leads on human prostate cancer LNCaP cell viability did not correlate with the ability of the compounds to cause down-regulation of AR protein expression. Through rational synthetic optimization of the lead compound (BTB01434), we have discovered a series of novel substituted diaryl molecules as potent anti-prostate cancer agents. Some compounds (1-6) were shown to be extremely potent inhibitors of LNCaP cell viability with GI(50) values in the nanomolar range (1.45-83 nM). The most potent compound (4-methylphenyl)[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]amine (5) with a GI(50) value of 1.45 nM is 27,000 times more potent than our lead compound BTB01434 (GI(50)=39.8 microM). In addition, some of the compounds exhibited modest anti-androgenic activities and one was also a potent inhibitor (GI(50)=850 nM) of PC-3 (AR-null) cell growth. A clear structure-activity relationship (SAR) has been established for activity against LNCaP cells, where potent molecules possess two substituted/unsubstituted aromatic rings connected through a sulfonamide linker.

The new steroidal compound, 15, thus constitutes a good starting point for development of future antiandrogens with a therapeutic potential against prostate cancer., Entry 2: Antiandrogens are commonly used to treat androgen-dependent disorders. The currently used drugs unfortunately possess very weak affinity for the human AR (hAR), thus indicating the need to develop new high-affinity steroidal antiandrogens. Our compounds are specially designed to impede repositioning of the mobile carboxyl-terminal helix 12, which blocks the ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) located in the AR ligand-binding domain (ARLBD). Using crystal structures of the hARLBD, we first found that H12 could be directly reached from the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) by a chain positioned on the C18 atom of an androgen steroid nucleus. A set of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone-derived molecules bearing various C18 chains were thus synthesized and tested for their capacity to bind hAR and act as antagonists. Although most of those having very high affinity for hAR were agonists, several very potent antagonists were obtained, confirming the structural importance of the C18 chain. To understand the role of the C18 chain in their agonistic/antagonistic properties, the structure of the hARLBD complexed with one of these agonists, EM5744, was determined at a 1.65-A resolution. We have identified new interactions involving Gln(738), Met(742), and His(874) that explain both the high affinity of this compound and the inability of its bulky chain to prevent the repositioning of H12. This structural information will be helpful to refine the structure of the chains placed on the C18 atom to obtain efficient H12-directed steroidal antiandrogens., Entry 3: A series of bipolar biphenyl compounds was synthesized as proteomimetic analogs of the LXXLL penta-peptide motif responsible for the binding of coactivator proteins to the nuclear hormone receptor coactivator binding domain.

AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported.

Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide). Notably, 6a maintains its antiandrogenic activity with AR mutants W741L and T877A commonly observed and activated by bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, in prostate cancer patients.","InChI=1S/C13H11F3N2O3/c14-13(15,16)10-6-7(18(19)20)4-5-8(10)12-9-2-1-3-11(9)21-17-12/h4-6,9,11H,1-3H2",0.62,-0.85,21.8,,,,,,,,

In order to solve the problem of drug resistance in the treatment of prostate cancer, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTAC) was introduced into the design of anti-prostate cancer derivatives. In this work, we synthesized two series of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) containing the hydrophobic degrons with different linker, and then investigated the structure-activity relationships of these hybrid compounds. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to good activity against all the cancer cell lines selected. Among them, compound A9 displayed potent inhibitory activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cell line with IC values of 1.75 μM, as well as excellent AR degradation activity. Primary mechanism studies elucidated compound A9 arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induced a mild apoptotic response in LNCaP cells. Further study indicated that the degradation of AR was mediated through proteasome-mediated process. For all these reasons, compound A9 held promising potential as anti-proliferative agent for the development of highly efficient SARDs for drug-resistance prostate cancer therapies.","InChI=1S/C43H51F3N6O8/c1-41(2)39(54)52(36-8-5-33(25-47)37(20-36)43(44,45)46)40(55)50(41)26-29-3-6-35(7-4-29)51-27-34(48-49-51)28-59-14-13-57-10-9-56-11-12-58-15-16-60-38(53)24-42-21-30-17-31(22-42)19-32(18-30)23-42/h3-8,20,27,30-32H,9-19,21-24,26,28H2,1-2H3",0.07,-1.10,51.75,,,,,,,,

Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain.

Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms. Most of these drugs show limited application due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1).

Using structure activity analysis, we established that the benzimidazole moiety at C-17 is essential and optimal and also that hydrophilic and heteroaromatic groups at C-3 enhance both antiproliferative (AP) and AR degrading (ARD) activities. The most potent antiproliferative compounds were 3β-(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (47), 3-((EZ)-hydroximino)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-4,16-diene (36), and 3β-(pyridine-4-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (43), with GI50 values of 0.87, 1.91, and 2.57 μM, respectively. Compared to 5, compound 47 was 4- and 8-fold more potent with respect to AP and ARD activities, respectively. Importantly, we also discovered that our compounds, including 5, 36, 43, and 47, could degrade both full-length and truncated ARs in CWR22rv1 human prostate cancer cells.

Among these, the chloride induced the best antiproliferative activity on androgen-sensitive Shionogi cells. Substituting the OH at C-3 by a methoxy group showed the importance of the OH. Moreover, its transformation into a ketone increased the androgen receptor (AR) binding but decreased the antiproliferative activity and induced a proliferative effect on Shionogi cells.

The new steroidal compound, 15, thus constitutes a good starting point for development of future antiandrogens with a therapeutic potential against prostate cancer., Entry 2: Antiandrogens are commonly used to treat androgen-dependent disorders. The currently used drugs unfortunately possess very weak affinity for the human AR (hAR), thus indicating the need to develop new high-affinity steroidal antiandrogens. Our compounds are specially designed to impede repositioning of the mobile carboxyl-terminal helix 12, which blocks the ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) located in the AR ligand-binding domain (ARLBD). Using crystal structures of the hARLBD, we first found that H12 could be directly reached from the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) by a chain positioned on the C18 atom of an androgen steroid nucleus. A set of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone-derived molecules bearing various C18 chains were thus synthesized and tested for their capacity to bind hAR and act as antagonists. Although most of those having very high affinity for hAR were agonists, several very potent antagonists were obtained, confirming the structural importance of the C18 chain. To understand the role of the C18 chain in their agonistic/antagonistic properties, the structure of the hARLBD complexed with one of these agonists, EM5744, was determined at a 1.65-A resolution. We have identified new interactions involving Gln(738), Met(742), and His(874) that explain both the high affinity of this compound and the inability of its bulky chain to prevent the repositioning of H12. This structural information will be helpful to refine the structure of the chains placed on the C18 atom to obtain efficient H12-directed steroidal antiandrogens., Entry 3: We report here the design, preparation, and systematic evaluation of a novel cycloalkane[d]isoxazole pharmacophoric fragment-containing androgen receptor (AR) modulators. Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide).

Ten compounds possessed potent cytotoxicity against both LNCaP and PC-3 cells, seven only against LNCaP, and one solely against PC-3.

Among these, the chloride induced the best antiproliferative activity on androgen-sensitive Shionogi cells. Substituting the OH at C-3 by a methoxy group showed the importance of the OH. Moreover, its transformation into a ketone increased the androgen receptor (AR) binding but decreased the antiproliferative activity and induced a proliferative effect on Shionogi cells. These results confirm the importance of keeping a 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol nucleus instead of a dihydrotestosterone nucleus. Variable side-chain lengths of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-methylenes at C-16alpha were investigated and the optimal length was found to be 3-methylenes. Although exhibiting a weak AR binding affinity, 16alpha-(3'-chloropropyl)-5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (15) provided an antiproliferative activity on Shionogi cells similar to that of pure non-steroidal antiandrogen hydroxy-flutamide (77% and 67%, respectively, at 0.1 microM). The new steroidal compound, 15, thus constitutes a good starting point for development of future antiandrogens with a therapeutic potential against prostate cancer., Entry 3: In our efforts to develop compounds with therapeutic potential as antiandrogens, we synthesized a series of 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol derivatives with a fixed side-chain length of 3-methylenes at C-16alpha, but bearing a diversity of functional groups at the end.

The new steroidal compound, 15, thus constitutes a good starting point for development of future antiandrogens with a therapeutic potential against prostate cancer., Entry 4: Antiandrogens are commonly used to treat androgen-dependent disorders. The currently used drugs unfortunately possess very weak affinity for the human AR (hAR), thus indicating the need to develop new high-affinity steroidal antiandrogens. Our compounds are specially designed to impede repositioning of the mobile carboxyl-terminal helix 12, which blocks the ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) located in the AR ligand-binding domain (ARLBD). Using crystal structures of the hARLBD, we first found that H12 could be directly reached from the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) by a chain positioned on the C18 atom of an androgen steroid nucleus. A set of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone-derived molecules bearing various C18 chains were thus synthesized and tested for their capacity to bind hAR and act as antagonists. Although most of those having very high affinity for hAR were agonists, several very potent antagonists were obtained, confirming the structural importance of the C18 chain. To understand the role of the C18 chain in their agonistic/antagonistic properties, the structure of the hARLBD complexed with one of these agonists, EM5744, was determined at a 1.65-A resolution. We have identified new interactions involving Gln(738), Met(742), and His(874) that explain both the high affinity of this compound and the inability of its bulky chain to prevent the repositioning of H12. This structural information will be helpful to refine the structure of the chains placed on the C18 atom to obtain efficient H12-directed steroidal antiandrogens., Entry 5: A novel series of 16-substituted-4-azasteroids has been identified as potential tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators. These ligands display potent hAR binding and agonist activity, low virilizing potential, and good pharmacokinetic profiles in dogs. On the basis of its in vitro profile, 21 was evaluated in the OVX and ORX rat models and exhibited an osteoanabolic, tissue-selective profile., Entry 6: Structural modification performed on a 4-methyl-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)hydantoin series is described which resulted in the development of a new series of 4-(hydroxymethyl)diarylhydantoin analogues as potent, partial agonists of the human androgen receptor. This led to the identification of (S)-(-)-4-(4-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methyl-2,5-dioxo-4-phenylimidazolidin-1-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile ((S)-(-)-18a, GLPG0492) evaluated in vivo in a classical model of orchidectomized rat. In this model, (-)-18a exhibited anabolic activity on muscle, strongly dissociated from the androgenic activity on prostate after oral dosing. (-)-18a has very good pharmacokinetic properties, including bioavailability in rat (F > 50%), and is currently under evaluation in phase I clinical trials., Entry 7: A novel selective androgen receptor modulator scaffold has been discovered through structural modifications of hydantoin antiandrogens. Several 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-N-arylhydantoins displayed partial agonism with nanomolar in vitro potency in transactivation experiments using androgen receptor (AR) transfected cells. In a standard castrated male rat model, several compounds showed good anabolic activity on levator ani muscle, dissociated from the androgenic activity on ventral prostate, after oral dosing at 30 mg/kg. (+)-4-[3,4-Dimethyl-2,5-dioxo-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)imidazolidin-1-yl]-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile ((+)-11b) displayed anabolic potency with a strong dissociation between levator ani muscle and ventral prostate (A(50) = 0.5 mg/kg vs 70 mg/kg). The binding modes of two compounds, including (+)-11b, within the AR ligand-binding domain have been studied by cocrystallization experiments using a coactivator-like peptide. Both compounds bound to the same site, and the overall structures of the AR were very similar., Entry 8: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., ","InChI=1S/C19H30O2/c1-18-9-7-13(20)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(21)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h12,14-17,21H,3-11H2,1-2H3/t12-,14-,15-,16-,17-,18-,19-/m0/s1",0.73,2.41,8.0,8.0,73.0,94.0,95.0,100.0,100.0,100.0,180.0

To capitalize on the discovery of RM-532-105, a steroidal 17β-HSD3 inhibitor, we explored the effect of its backbone configuration on inhibitory activity, androgenic profile, and metabolic stability. Two modifications that greatly alter the natural shape of steroids, i.e. inversion of the methyl on carbon 13 (13α-CH3 instead of 13β-CH3) and inversion of the hydrogen on carbon 5 (5β-H instead of 5α-H), were tested after the syntheses in 6 steps of 2 isomeric forms (5α/13α-RM-532-105 (6a) and 5β/13β-RM-532-105 (6b), respectively) of the 17β-HSD3 inhibitor RM-532-105 (5α/13β-configurations). For compound 6b, a cis/trans junction of the A/B rings did not significantly alter the inhibitory activity on 17β-HSD3 (IC50=0.15μM) as well as the liver microsomal stability (16.6% of 6b remaining after 1h incubation) compared to RM-532-105 (IC50=0.11μM and 14.1% remaining). In contrast, a trans/cis junction of C/D rings reduced the inhibitory activity on 17β-HSD3 (IC50=1.09μM) but increased the metabolic stability with 29.4% of compound 6a remaining after incubation. The structural modifications represented by compounds 6a and 6b did not change the non-androgenicity profile of an androsterone derivative such as RM-532-105, but slightly increased its cytotoxic activity.","InChI=1S/C19H30O2/c1-18-9-7-13(20)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(21)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h12,14-17,21H,3-11H2,1-2H3/t12-,14+,15+,16+,17+,18+,19+/m1/s1",0.73,2.41,190.0,,,,,,,,

Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs. Design, synthesis, and biological activity of novel SARDs that could potentially be used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of PCs including castration-resistant, Enz-R, and/or AR SV-dependent advanced PCs that are often untreatable with known hormone therapies are discussed.","InChI=1S/C19H15ClFN3O2/c1-19(26,11-24-7-6-12-8-14(21)3-5-17(12)24)18(25)23-15-4-2-13(10-22)16(20)9-15/h2-9,26H,11H2,1H3,(H,23,25)/t19-/m0/s1",0.73,-1.84,61.0,,,,,,,,

In order to solve the problem of drug resistance in the treatment of prostate cancer, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTAC) was introduced into the design of anti-prostate cancer derivatives. In this work, we synthesized two series of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) containing the hydrophobic degrons with different linker, and then investigated the structure-activity relationships of these hybrid compounds. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to good activity against all the cancer cell lines selected. Among them, compound A9 displayed potent inhibitory activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cell line with IC values of 1.75 μM, as well as excellent AR degradation activity. Primary mechanism studies elucidated compound A9 arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induced a mild apoptotic response in LNCaP cells. Further study indicated that the degradation of AR was mediated through proteasome-mediated process.

Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms.

Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations.

Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs. Design, synthesis, and biological activity of novel SARDs that could potentially be used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of PCs including castration-resistant, Enz-R, and/or AR SV-dependent advanced PCs that are often untreatable with known hormone therapies are discussed.","InChI=1S/C19H17BrClN3O2/c1-19(26,11-24-7-6-12-8-14(20)3-5-17(12)24)18(25)23-15-4-2-13(10-22)16(21)9-15/h2-5,8-9,26H,6-7,11H2,1H3,(H,23,25)/t19-/m0/s1",0.77,-1.60,31.0,,,,,,,,

Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs.

However, structural rearrangement reveals a potential liability for clinical applications. We herein report our designer RgIA analogues stabilized by methylene thioacetal as nonopioid analgesic agents. We demonstrate that replacing disulfide loop I [Cys<sup>I</sup>-Cys<sup>III</sup>] with methylene thioacetal in the RgIA skeleton results in activity loss, whereas substitution of loop II [Cys<sup>II</sup>-Cys<sup>IV</sup>] can be accommodated. The lead molecule, RgIA-5524, exhibits highly selective inhibition of α9α10 nAChRs with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.9 nM and much reduced degradation in human serum. <i>In vivo</i> studies showed that RgIA-5524 relieves chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in wild type but not α9 knockout mouse models, demonstrating that α9-containing nAChRs are necessary for the therapeutic effects.

Initial studies of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (1) and agonist (2) propanamides yielded a tertiary aniline (3) with novel SARD activity but poor metabolic stability. Cyclization to II and III produced submicromolar AR antagonism and protein degradation selective to AR and AR splice variant (AR SV). II and III maintained potency against enzalutamide-resistant (Enz-R) mutant ARs and PC cells and were efficacious in Enz-R xenografts, suggesting their potential to treat advanced PCs. Design, synthesis, and biological activity of novel SARDs that could potentially be used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of PCs including castration-resistant, Enz-R, and/or AR SV-dependent advanced PCs that are often untreatable with known hormone therapies are discussed.","InChI=1S/C19H16ClF2N3O2/c1-19(27,18(26)24-13-3-2-12(9-23)14(20)7-13)10-25-5-4-11-6-15(21)16(22)8-17(11)25/h2-3,6-8,27H,4-5,10H2,1H3,(H,24,26)/t19-/m0/s1",0.84,-1.68,61.0,,,,,,,,

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

Within the series, compound (R)-6 (ONC1-13B) and its related analogues, including its active N-dealkylated metabolite, were found to be the most potent molecules with the target activity (IC50, androgen-sensitive human PCa LNCaP cells) in the range of 59-80 nM (inhibition of PSA production). The disclosed hits were at least two times more active than bicalutamide, nilutamide and enzalutamide within the performed assay. Several compounds were classified as partial agonists.

Comparative SAR and 3D molecular docking studies were performed for the hit compounds elucidating the observed differences in the binding potency., Entry 1: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies affecting men worldwide. Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model.

Among them, compound A9 displayed potent inhibitory activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cell line with IC values of 1.75 μM, as well as excellent AR degradation activity. Primary mechanism studies elucidated compound A9 arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induced a mild apoptotic response in LNCaP cells. Further study indicated that the degradation of AR was mediated through proteasome-mediated process.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.
