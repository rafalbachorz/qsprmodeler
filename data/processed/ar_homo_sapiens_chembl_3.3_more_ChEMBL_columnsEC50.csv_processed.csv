CRPC is characterized by reactivation of the androgen axis due to changes in androgen receptor signaling and/or adaptive intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. AKR1C3 is upregulated in CRPC where it catalyzes the formation of potent androgens. This makes AKR1C3 a target for the treatment of CRPC. AKR1C3 inhibitors should not inhibit AKR1C1/AKR1C2, which inactivate 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Indomethacin, used to inhibit cyclooxygenase, also inhibits AKR1C3 and displays selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2. Parallel synthetic strategies were used to generate libraries of indomethacin analogues, which exhibit reduced cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity but retain AKR1C3 inhibitory potency and selectivity. The lead compounds inhibited AKR1C3 with nanomolar potency, displayed >100-fold selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2, and blocked testosterone formation in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells. The AKR1C3·NADP(+)·2'-des-methyl-indomethacin crystal structure was determined, and it revealed a unique inhibitor binding mode. The compounds reported are promising agents for the development of therapeutics for CRPC.",,COc1ccc2c(c1)c(CC(=O)O)c(C)n2C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1,C19H16ClNO4,CHEMBL6,0.14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.14,0.14,0.14,0.14,-0.8538719643217619,-0.8538719643217619,-0.8538719643217619,9.853871964321762,9.853871964321762,9.853871964321762,1,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

The parent compound, 4-(trifluoromethyl)-2(1H)-pyrrolidino[3,2-g]quinolinone, displayed moderate interaction with hAR, but more substituted analogues, particularly 6,7-disubstituted compounds, were potent hAR agonists in vitro., Entry 1: New nonsteroidal human androgen receptor (hAR) agonists were developed from an hAR antagonist pharmacophore, 2(1H)-piperidino[3,2-g]quinolinone. (+/-)-trans-7,8-Diethyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2(H)-piperidino-[3,2-g]quinoli none was synthesized and demonstrated potent hAR agonist activity (EC50=3 nM) in the cell-based cotransfection assay and high binding affinity (Ki=16 nM) in the competitive receptor binding assay., Entry 2: A series of human androgen receptor (hAR) agonists based on 4-alkyl-; 4,4-dialkyl-; and 3,4-dialkyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-pyridono[5,6-g]quinoline was synthesized and evaluated in competitive receptor binding assays and an androgen receptor cotransfection assay in a mammalian cell background. A number of compounds in this series demonstrated activity equal to or better than dihydrotestosterone in both assays and represent a novel class of compounds for use in androgen replacement therapy., Entry 3: A series of 2H-pyrano[3,2-g]quinolin-2-ones was prepared and tested for the ability to modulate the transcriptional activity of the human androgen receptor (hAR). The parent compound, 4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrano[3,2-g]quinolin-2-one, displayed moderate interaction with hAR, but substituted analogues were potent hAR modulators in vitro as measured by an hAR cotransfection assay in CV-1 cells and bound to hAR with high affinity in a whole cell assay. Several analogues were able to activate hAR-mediated gene transcription more potently and efficaciously than dihydrotestosterone., Entry 4: The androgen receptor is a member of the extended family of nuclear receptors and is widely distributed throughout the body. Androgen therapy is used to compensate for low levels of the natural hormones testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone and consists of administration of T, prodrugs thereof, or synthetic androgens. However, currently available androgens have many drawbacks. We identified 6-dialkylamino-4-trifluoromethylquinolin-2(1H)-ones as orally available tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators., Entry 5: Recent interest in orally available androgens has fueled the search for new androgens for use in hormone replacement therapy and as anabolic agents. In pursuit of this, we have discovered a series of novel androgen receptor modulators derived from 7H-[1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones. These compounds were synthesized and evaluated in competitive binding assays and an androgen receptor transcriptional activation assay. A number of compounds from the series demonstrated single-digit nanomolar agonist activity in vitro. In addition, lead compound (R)-16e was orally active in established rodent models that measure androgenic and anabolic properties of these agents. In this assay, (R)-16e demonstrated full efficacy in muscle and only partially stimulated the prostate at 100 mg/kg. These data suggest that these compounds may be utilized as selective androgen receptor modulators or SARMs. This series represents a novel class of compounds for use in androgen replacement therapy., Entry 6: A series of alkylamino-2-quinolinone compounds (3) was discovered as androgen receptor modulators based on an early linear tricyclic quinoline pharmacophore (1). The series demonstrated selective high binding affinity to androgen receptor and potent receptor modulating activities in the cotransfection assays., Entry 7: A series of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) with a wide spectrum of receptor modulating activities was developed based on optimization of the 4-substituted 6-bisalkylamino-2-quinolinones (3). Significance of the trifluoromethyl group on the side chains and its interactions with amino acid residues within the androgen receptor (AR) ligand binding domain are discussed. A representative analog (9) was tested orally in a rodent model of hypogonadism and demonstrated desirable tissue selectivity., Entry 8: The androgen receptor is a ligand inducible transcription factor that is involved in a broad range of physiological functions. Here we describe the discovery of a new class of orally available selective androgen receptor modulators. The lead compound, 6-[(2R,5R)-2-methyl-5-((R)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl]-4-trifluoromethylquinolin-2(1H)-one (6a), showed excellent anabolic activity in muscle with reduced effect on the prostate in a rat model of hypogonadism. The compound also improved bone strength in a rat model of post-menopausal osteoporosis., Entry 9: A series of androgen receptor modulators based on 8H-[1,4]oxazino[2,3-f]quinolin-8-ones was synthesized and evaluated in an androgen receptor transcriptional activation assay. The most potent analogues from the series exhibited single-digit nanomolar potency in vitro. Compound 18h demonstrated full efficacy in the maintenance of muscle weight, at 10 mg/kg, with reduced activity in prostate weight in an in vivo model of androgen action., Entry 10: A novel oxachrysenone series (2) of nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM) was developed based on the 6-aryl-2-quinolinones (1). Synthesis and preliminary SAR results based on in vitro assays are discussed. In the cotransfection assay, lead compound 5d showed AR agonist activity more potent than dihydrotestosterone (DHT), whereas compound 17b was a potent antagonist similar to bicalutamide., Entry 11: Modification on a lead series of [1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones at the 2-position led to selective androgen receptor modulators with improved in vivo activity. The most potent analog (-)-33a exhibited full maintenance of levator ani muscle at 3mg/kg and reduced activity on ventral prostate weight in a 2-week orally-dosed and orchidectomized rat maintenance assay., Entry 12: A novel series of 16-substituted-4-azasteroids has been identified as potential tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators. These ligands display potent hAR binding and agonist activity, low virilizing potential, and good pharmacokinetic profiles in dogs. On the basis of its in vitro profile, 21 was evaluated in the OVX and ORX rat models and exhibited an osteoanabolic, tissue-selective profile., Entry 13: Four new indolosesquiterpenes, lecanindoles A-D (1-4), were isolated from fermentations of the terrestrial fungus Verticillium lecanii 6144. The structures of compounds 1-4 were elucidated from analysis of spectroscopic data. Compound 2 was reduced to give 4 and its isomer 5. Compound 4 was found to be a potent and selective progesterone receptor agonist with an EC50 of 1.1 +/- 0.4 nM in a cell-based luciferase reporter assay., Entry 14: This report describes the discovery of RAD140, a potent, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM). The characterization of RAD140 in several preclinical models of anabolic androgen action is also described., Entry 15: A series of 4-phenylpyrrole derivatives D were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their potential as novel orally available androgen receptor antagonists therapeutically effective against castration-resistant prostate cancers. 4-Phenylpyrrole compound 1 exhibited androgen receptor (AR) antagonistic activity against T877A and W741C mutant-type ARs as well as wild-type AR. An arylmethyl group incorporated into compound 1 contributed to enhancement of antagonistic activity. Compound 4n, 1-{[6-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl)pyridin-3-yl]methyl}-4-(4-cyanophenyl)-2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor cell growth against the bicalutamide-resistant LNCaP-cxD2 cell line as well as the androgen receptor-dependent JDCaP cell line in a mouse xenograft model. These results demonstrate that this series of pyrrole compounds are novel androgen receptor antagonists with efficacy against prostate cancer cells, including castration-resistant prostate cancers such as bicalutamide-resistant prostate cancer., Entry 16: A series of 4-phenylpyrrole derivatives D were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their potential as novel orally available androgen receptor antagonists therapeutically effective against castration-resistant prostate cancers. 4-Phenylpyrrole compound 1 exhibited androgen receptor (AR) antagonistic activity against T877A and W741C mutant-type ARs as well as wild-type AR.

These results demonstrate that this series of pyrrole compounds are novel androgen receptor antagonists with efficacy against prostate cancer cells, including castration-resistant prostate cancers such as bicalutamide-resistant prostate cancer., Entry 18: We designed and synthesized a series of 3-aryl-3-hydroxy-1-phenylpyrrolidine derivatives D and evaluated their potential as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists therapeutically effective against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Introduction of a methyl group at the 2-position (R(2)) of the pyrrolidine ring increased the AR binding affinity. The (2S,3R) configuration of the pyrrolidine ring was favorable for the AR antagonistic activity. It was found that introduction of an amide substituent (R(1)) and a pyridin-3-yl group (Q) was effective for reducing the AR agonistic activity which appeared during the optimization of lead compound 6. Compound 54 showed potent antitumor effects against a CRPC model of LNCaP-hr cell line in a mouse xenograft, in which bicalutamide exhibited only partial suppression of tumor growth. Thus, the pyrrolidine derivatives such as 54 are novel AR antagonists, and their properties having efficacy against CRPC are distinct from those of a representative first-generation antagonist, bicalutamide., Entry 19: We designed and synthesized a series of 3-aryl-3-hydroxy-1-phenylpyrrolidine derivatives D and evaluated their potential as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists therapeutically effective against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Thus, the pyrrolidine derivatives such as 54 are novel AR antagonists, and their properties having efficacy against CRPC are distinct from those of a representative first-generation antagonist, bicalutamide., Entry 20: Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (RORγt) is a key transcription factor for the development of Th17 cells. Inhibiting RORγt activity is thought to be beneficial in targeting a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Recently N-(5-(arylcarbonyl)thiazol-2-yl)amides were described as RORγt antagonists with in vivo efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) via oral administration. So far no selective small molecule ligands have been revealed for RORβ. We show, that one compound of this class, namely N-[5-(2-chloro-benzoyl)-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-thiazol-2-yl]-2-(4-ethanesulfonyl-phenyl)-acetamide (4) is a potent dual inverse agonist towards RORγt and RORβ devoid of activity to 18 other human nuclear receptors and thus can serve as chemical probe to deepen our understanding about RORβ and its biology., Entry 21: We describe the synthesis and characterization of 3-alkoxy-pyrrolo[1,2-b]pyrazolines as novel selective androgen receptor (AR) modulators that possess excellent physicochemical properties for transdermal administration. Compound 26 bound to human AR with an IC50 of 0.7 nM with great selectivity over other nuclear hormone receptors and potently activated AR in a C2C12 muscle cell reporter gene assay with an EC50 of 0.5 nM. It showed high aqueous solubility of 1.3 g/L at pH 7.4, and an in silico model as well as a customized parallel artificial membrane permeability assay indicated good skin permeation. Indeed, when measuring skin permeation through excised human skin, an excellent flux of 2 μg/(cm(2)·h) was determined without any permeation enhancers. In a 2 week Hershberger model using castrated rats, the compound showed dose-dependent effects fully restoring skeletal muscle weight at 0.3 mg/kg/day after subcutaneous administration with high selectivity over prostate stimulation., Entry 22: We previously reported that 4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)benzonitrile derivative 1b was a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that exhibited anabolic effects on organs such as muscles and the central nervous system (CNS), but neutral effects on the prostate. From further modification, we identified that 4-(5-oxopyrrolidine-1-yl)benzonitrile derivative 2a showed strong AR binding affinity with improved metabolic stabilities. Based on these results, we tried to enhance the AR agonistic activities by modifying the substituents of the 5-oxopyrrolidine ring. As a consequence, we found that 4-[(2S,3S)-2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-5-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl]-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (2f) had ideal SARM profiles in Hershberger assay and sexual behavior induction assay. Furthermore, 2f showed good pharmacokinetic profiles in rats, dogs, monkeys, excellent nuclear selectivity and acceptable toxicological profiles. We also determined its binding mode by obtaining the co-crystal structures with AR., Entry 23: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., Entry 24: The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in the maintenance of muscle and bone and the support of male sexual-related functions, as well as in the progression of prostate cancer. Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,C[C@]12CCC(=O)C[C@@H]1CC[C@@H]1[C@@H]2CC[C@]2(C)[C@@H](O)CC[C@@H]12,C19H30O2,CHEMBL27769,0.05,0.1,0.13,0.14,0.18,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.1,5.1,5.1,5.1,5.1,5.7,5.7,5.7,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.2,6.2,12.0,15.0,15.0,20.0,3.9382178710680797,0.05,5.263999999999999,5.1,15.0,0.721315880605899,0.7075701760979364,-1.3010299956639813,8.278684119394102,8.292429823902063,10.301029995663981,25,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

First line therapy for disseminated disease relies on androgen deprivation, leveraging the addiction of these tumors on androgens for both growth and survival. Treatment typically involves antagonizing the androgen receptor (AR) or blocking the synthesis of androgens. Recurrence is common and within 2-3years patients develop castration resistant tumors that become unresponsive to AR-axis targeted therapies. In order to provide a more effective treatment, we are utilizing an approach that targets a key scaffolding protein, Sigma1 (also known as sigma-1 receptor), a unique 26-kilodalton integral membrane protein that is critical in stabilizing the AR.

Compound 6 had minimal effect on HDL-C levels in cynomolgus monkeys and showed human cadaver skin permeability, thus making it an effective tool for proof-of-concept studies in a clinical setting., Entry 1: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., ",,C[C@]1(O)CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4=C3C=C[C@@]21C,C19H24O2,CHEMBL166444,0.013,0.11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0485,0.013,0.0615,0.0615,0.11,-1.2111248842245832,-1.2111248842245832,-1.8860566476931633,10.211124884224583,10.211124884224583,10.886056647693163,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

However, currently available androgens have many drawbacks. We identified 6-dialkylamino-4-trifluoromethylquinolin-2(1H)-ones as orally available tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators., Entry 1: A series of alkylamino-2-quinolinone compounds (3) was discovered as androgen receptor modulators based on an early linear tricyclic quinoline pharmacophore (1).

A representative analog (9) was tested orally in a rodent model of hypogonadism and demonstrated desirable tissue selectivity., Entry 3: The androgen receptor is a ligand inducible transcription factor that is involved in a broad range of physiological functions. Here we describe the discovery of a new class of orally available selective androgen receptor modulators. The lead compound, 6-[(2R,5R)-2-methyl-5-((R)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl]-4-trifluoromethylquinolin-2(1H)-one (6a), showed excellent anabolic activity in muscle with reduced effect on the prostate in a rat model of hypogonadism. The compound also improved bone strength in a rat model of post-menopausal osteoporosis., Entry 4: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., Entry 5: The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in the maintenance of muscle and bone and the support of male sexual-related functions, as well as in the progression of prostate cancer. Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,O=c1cc(C(F)(F)F)c2cc(N(CC(F)(F)F)CC(F)(F)F)ccc2[nH]1,C14H9F9N2O,CHEMBL436784,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.7755575615628914e-17,0.2,0.20000000000000004,0.2,0.2,-0.6989700043360187,-0.6989700043360187,-0.6989700043360187,9.698970004336019,9.698970004336019,9.698970004336019,6,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,C[C@H]1COc2cc3[nH]c(=O)cc(C(F)(F)F)c3cc2N1CC(F)(F)F,C15H12F6N2O2,CHEMBL227088,1.1,3.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.3499999999999999,1.1,2.45,2.45,3.8,0.3891660843645325,0.3891660843645325,0.04139268515822508,8.610833915635467,8.610833915635467,8.958607314841775,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.

Compound 14 and its analog 13 possessed sub-nanomolar in vitro potency (EC(50) 0.1-0.5nM) in the T47D alkaline phosphatase assay, similar to that of the steroidal PR agonist medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). In contrast to MPA, 14 was highly selective (>500-fold) for the PR over both glucocorticoid and androgen receptors. In the rat uterine decidualization and complement component C3 models, 14 had oral ED(50) values of 0.02 and 0.003mg/kg, respectively, and was from 6- to 20-fold more potent than MPA.

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., ",,O=c1cc(C(F)(F)F)c2cc3c(cc2[nH]1)OC[C@H](C(F)(F)F)N3CC(F)(F)F,C15H9F9N2O2,CHEMBL401805,2.0,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5,2.0,12.5,12.5,23.0,1.0969100130080565,1.0969100130080565,0.3010299956639812,7.903089986991944,7.903089986991944,8.698970004336019,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

With these activities, they have potential for development as new drugs for the treatment of all forms of prostate cancer., Entry 2: Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of cancer related death in men. First line therapy for disseminated disease relies on androgen deprivation, leveraging the addiction of these tumors on androgens for both growth and survival. Treatment typically involves antagonizing the androgen receptor (AR) or blocking the synthesis of androgens. Recurrence is common and within 2-3years patients develop castration resistant tumors that become unresponsive to AR-axis targeted therapies. In order to provide a more effective treatment, we are utilizing an approach that targets a key scaffolding protein, Sigma1 (also known as sigma-1 receptor), a unique 26-kilodalton integral membrane protein that is critical in stabilizing the AR. Herein we report on a new series of Sigma1 compounds for lead optimization derived from a hybrid pharmacophore approach., Entry 3: After a high-throughput screening campaign identified thioether 1 as an antagonist of the nuclear androgen receptor, a zone model was developed for structure-activity relationship (SAR) purposes and analogues were synthesized and evaluated in a cell-based luciferase assay. A novel thioether isostere, cyclopropane (1S,2R)-27, showed the desired increased potency and structural properties (stereospecific SAR response, absence of a readily oxidized sulfur atom, low molecular weight, reduced number of flexible bonds and polar surface area, and drug-likeness score) in the prostate-specific antigen luciferase assay in C4-2-PSA-rl cells to qualify as a new lead structure for prostate cancer drug development., Entry 4: Degradation of all forms of androgen receptors (ARs) is emerging as an advantageous therapeutic paradigm for the effective treatment of prostate cancer. In continuation of our program to identify and develop improved efficacious novel small-molecule agents designed to disrupt AR signaling through enhanced AR degradation, we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated novel C-3 modified analogues of our phase 3 clinical agent, galeterone (5). Concerns of potential in vivo stability of our recently discovered more efficacious galeterone 3β-imidazole carbamate (6) led to the design and synthesis of new steroidal compounds. Two of the 11 compounds, 3β-pyridyl ether (8) and 3β-imidazole (17) with antiproliferative GI50 values of 3.24 and 2.54 μM against CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cell, are 2.75- and 3.5-fold superior to 5. In addition, compounds 8 and 17 possess improved (∼4-fold) AR-V7 degrading activities. Importantly, these two compounds are expected to be metabolically stable, making them suitable for further development as new therapeutics against all forms of prostate cancer., Entry 5: Persistent androgen receptor (AR) activation drives therapeutic resistance to second-generation AR pathway inhibitors and contributes to the progression of advanced prostate cancer. One resistance mechanism is point mutations in the ligand binding domain of AR that can transform antagonists into agonists. The AR F877L mutation, identified in patients treated with enzalutamide or apalutamide, confers resistance to both enzalutamide and apalutamide. Compound <b>4</b> (JNJ-pan-AR) was identified as a pan-AR antagonist with potent activity against wild-type and clinically relevant AR mutations including F877L. Metabolite identification studies revealed a latent bioactivation pathway associated with <b>4</b>. Subsequent lead optimization of <b>4</b> led to amelioration of this pathway and nomination of <b>5</b> (JNJ-63576253) as a clinical stage, next-generation AR antagonist for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)., Entry 6: The androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are efficient therapeutics for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). All the approved AR antagonists to date are targeted to the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of AR and have suffered from various drug resistances, whereas AR antagonist targeting non-LBP site of AR is conceived as a promising strategy. Through the scaffold hopping of AR LBP antagonists, the 2-chloro-4-(1<i>H</i>-pyrazol-1-yl)benzonitrile was designed as a new core structure for AR antagonists. A total of 46 compounds were synthesized and biologically evaluated to disclose compounds <b>2f</b>, <b>2k</b>, and <b>4c</b>, exhibiting potent AR antagonistic activities (IC<sub>50</sub> up to 69 nM), force against antiandrogen resistance, and untraditional targeting site of probably AR binding function 3. Therein, <b>4c</b> exhibited effective tumor growth inhibition in LNCaP xenograft study upon oral administration.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,CNC(=O)c1ccc(N2C(=S)N(c3ccc(C#N)c(C(F)(F)F)c3)C(=O)C2(C)C)cc1F,C21H16F4N4O2S,CHEMBL1082407,49.0,61.8,180.0,420.0,915.0,1070.0,1100.0,1100.0,11390.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3413.6905294872754,49.0,1809.5333333333333,915.0,11390.0,3.257566587637307,2.9614210940664485,1.6901960800285136,5.7424334123626934,6.0385789059335515,7.309803919971486,9,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects.

Preclinical data suggest that antagonists of this nuclear receptor may enhance the activity of anticancer therapy. The first-generation GR antagonist mifepristone is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in various oncology settings. Structure-based modification of mifepristone led to the discovery of ORIC-101 (28), a highly potent steroidal GR antagonist with reduced androgen receptor (AR) agonistic activity amenable for dosing in androgen receptor positive tumors and with improved CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 inhibition profile to minimize drug-drug interaction potential. Unlike mifepristone, 28 could be codosed with chemotherapeutic agents readily metabolized by CYP2C8 such as paclitaxel. Furthermore, 28 demonstrated in vivo antitumor activity by enhancing response to chemotherapy in the GR+ OVCAR5 ovarian cancer xenograft model. Clinical evaluation of safety and therapeutic potential of 28 is underway., Entry 2: Structure-based modification of mifepristone (1) led to the discovery of novel mifepristone derivatives with improved selectivity profile.

Using structure activity analysis, we established that the benzimidazole moiety at C-17 is essential and optimal and also that hydrophilic and heteroaromatic groups at C-3 enhance both antiproliferative (AP) and AR degrading (ARD) activities. The most potent antiproliferative compounds were 3β-(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (47), 3-((EZ)-hydroximino)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-4,16-diene (36), and 3β-(pyridine-4-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (43), with GI50 values of 0.87, 1.91, and 2.57 μM, respectively. Compared to 5, compound 47 was 4- and 8-fold more potent with respect to AP and ARD activities, respectively. Importantly, we also discovered that our compounds, including 5, 36, 43, and 47, could degrade both full-length and truncated ARs in CWR22rv1 human prostate cancer cells.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)CCN1c1ccc(C#N)c2ccccc12,C16H16N2O,CHEMBL3402228,0.25,0.32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.035,0.25,0.28500000000000003,0.28500000000000003,0.32,-0.5451551399914898,-0.5451551399914898,-0.6020599913279624,9.54515513999149,9.54515513999149,9.602059991327963,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

We have taken advantage of the lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE) parameter as a guide to interpret the effect of structural changes on AR activity. Over the course of optimization efforts the LLE increased over 3 log units leading to a SARM 43 with nanomolar potency, good aqueous kinetic solubility (>700 μM), and high oral bioavailability in rats (83%)., Entry 1: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation.

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects.

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., ",,N#Cc1ccc(C(O)(c2cocn2)C(F)(F)F)cc1C(F)(F)F,C13H6F6N2O2,CHEMBL3818224,1.259,1.26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.000500000000000056,1.259,1.2595,1.2595,1.26,0.10019817183413186,0.10019817183413186,0.10002573010786256,8.899801828165868,8.899801828165868,8.899974269892137,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.

First line therapy for disseminated disease relies on androgen deprivation, leveraging the addiction of these tumors on androgens for both growth and survival. Treatment typically involves antagonizing the androgen receptor (AR) or blocking the synthesis of androgens. Recurrence is common and within 2-3years patients develop castration resistant tumors that become unresponsive to AR-axis targeted therapies. In order to provide a more effective treatment, we are utilizing an approach that targets a key scaffolding protein, Sigma1 (also known as sigma-1 receptor), a unique 26-kilodalton integral membrane protein that is critical in stabilizing the AR.

However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects.

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.

We also determined its binding mode by obtaining the co-crystal structures with AR., Entry 1: Osteoporosis is a common disease in which the risk of fracture increases due to decreased bone mass and qualitative skeletal changes. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are agonists with tissue selectivity, which act as partial or weak androgen receptor (AR) agonists in androgenic tissues, but mainly as complete AR agonists in synthetic metabolic tissues. In the recent 20 years, many scaffolds of SARMs have been reported, among which several molecules are promising and are undergoing clinical trial evaluation. However, it is still a challenge to discover SARMs with high activity and reduced side effects. In this review, not only are structure of SARMs reported in the literatures systematically collected and classified but also the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the advances in SARMs as potential treatment for osteoporosis are also updated., ",,Cc1c(N2CC[C@](C)(O)[C@@H]2C)ccc(C#N)c1F,C14H17FN2O,CHEMBL4092535,0.29,0.29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.29,0.29,0.29,0.29,-0.5376020021010439,-0.5376020021010439,-0.5376020021010439,9.537602002101044,9.537602002101044,9.537602002101044,2,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

First line therapy for disseminated disease relies on androgen deprivation, leveraging the addiction of these tumors on androgens for both growth and survival. Treatment typically involves antagonizing the androgen receptor (AR) or blocking the synthesis of androgens. Recurrence is common and within 2-3years patients develop castration resistant tumors that become unresponsive to AR-axis targeted therapies. In order to provide a more effective treatment, we are utilizing an approach that targets a key scaffolding protein, Sigma1 (also known as sigma-1 receptor), a unique 26-kilodalton integral membrane protein that is critical in stabilizing the AR.

From further modification, we identified that 4-(5-oxopyrrolidine-1-yl)benzonitrile derivative 2a showed strong AR binding affinity with improved metabolic stabilities. Based on these results, we tried to enhance the AR agonistic activities by modifying the substituents of the 5-oxopyrrolidine ring. As a consequence, we found that 4-[(2S,3S)-2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-5-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl]-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (2f) had ideal SARM profiles in Hershberger assay and sexual behavior induction assay.

Addition of a methyl group at the C10 position of the steroid has a significant impact on progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) activity. Within this series, OP-3633 (15) emerged as a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist with increased selectivity against PR and AR, improved cytochrome P450 inhibition profile, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to 1. Furthermore, 15 demonstrated substantial inhibition of GR transcriptional activity in the GR positive HCC1806 triple negative breast cancer xenograft model. Overall, compound 15 is a promising GR antagonist candidate to clinically evaluate the impact of GR inhibition in reversal or prevention of therapy resistance., ",,CN(C)c1ccc([C@H]2C[C@@]3(C)[C@@H](CC[C@@]3(O)C#CC(C)(C)C)[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4=C32)cc1,C32H41NO2,CHEMBL4163069,2500.0,2500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2500.0,2500.0,2500.0,2500.0,3.3979400086720375,3.3979400086720375,3.3979400086720375,5.6020599913279625,5.6020599913279625,5.6020599913279625,2,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE,ACTIVE

Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer.
