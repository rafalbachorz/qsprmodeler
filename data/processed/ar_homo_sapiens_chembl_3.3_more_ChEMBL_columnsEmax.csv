Preclinical data suggest that antagonists of this nuclear receptor may enhance the activity of anticancer therapy. The first-generation GR antagonist mifepristone is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in various oncology settings. Structure-based modification of mifepristone led to the discovery of ORIC-101 (28), a highly potent steroidal GR antagonist with reduced androgen receptor (AR) agonistic activity amenable for dosing in androgen receptor positive tumors and with improved CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 inhibition profile to minimize drug-drug interaction potential. Unlike mifepristone, 28 could be codosed with chemotherapeutic agents readily metabolized by CYP2C8 such as paclitaxel. Furthermore, 28 demonstrated in vivo antitumor activity by enhancing response to chemotherapy in the GR+ OVCAR5 ovarian cancer xenograft model.

High-throughput screening is often plagued by low hit rates and many leads that are toxic or exhibit poor bioavailability. Exploiting the secondary activity of marketed drugs, on the other hand, may help in generating drug leads that can be optimized for the observed side-effect target, while maintaining acceptable bioavailability and toxicity profiles. Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico ""drug repurposing"" procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives acetophenazine, fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics.","InChI=1S/C25H16F3NOS/c26-25(27,28)17-12-13-24-21(14-17)29(20-10-3-4-11-23(20)31-24)15-22(30)19-9-5-7-16-6-1-2-8-18(16)19/h1-14H,15H2",0.31,-1.26,76.0,,

One resistance mechanism is point mutations in the ligand binding domain of AR that can transform antagonists into agonists. The AR F877L mutation, identified in patients treated with enzalutamide or apalutamide, confers resistance to both enzalutamide and apalutamide. Compound <b>4</b> (JNJ-pan-AR) was identified as a pan-AR antagonist with potent activity against wild-type and clinically relevant AR mutations including F877L. Metabolite identification studies revealed a latent bioactivation pathway associated with <b>4</b>.

Compound 26 bound to human AR with an IC50 of 0.7 nM with great selectivity over other nuclear hormone receptors and potently activated AR in a C2C12 muscle cell reporter gene assay with an EC50 of 0.5 nM. It showed high aqueous solubility of 1.3 g/L at pH 7.4, and an in silico model as well as a customized parallel artificial membrane permeability assay indicated good skin permeation. Indeed, when measuring skin permeation through excised human skin, an excellent flux of 2 μg/(cm(2)·h) was determined without any permeation enhancers. In a 2 week Hershberger model using castrated rats, the compound showed dose-dependent effects fully restoring skeletal muscle weight at 0.3 mg/kg/day after subcutaneous administration with high selectivity over prostate stimulation.","InChI=1S/C15H15ClFN3O/c1-8-11(4-3-9(6-18)13(8)16)14-15(21-2)12-5-10(17)7-20(12)19-14/h3-4,10,12,15H,5,7H2,1-2H3/t10-,12-,15-/m0/s1",0.84,-0.41,86.0,,
