Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists.

Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases.","InChI=1S/C18H21F3N2O/c1-9-8-17(3,4)22-15-10(2)16-12(6-11(9)15)13(18(19,20)21)7-14(24)23(16)5/h6-7,9,22H,8H2,1-5H3",0.76,-0.15,70.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases.","InChI=1S/C17H19F3N2O/c1-16(2)6-5-10-7-11-12(17(18,19)20)8-15(23)21(3)14(11)9-13(10)22(16)4/h7-9H,5-6H2,1-4H3",0.74,-0.48,81.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis.

This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists.

Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

A number of potent analogues were identified by modification of the substituents at the D-ring., Entry 1: Herein we describe the chemical synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a novel, highly potent progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist, ZK 230211. The introduction of a 17alpha-pentafluorethyl side chain in the D-ring of the steroid skeleton allowed the combination of high antiprogestagenic activity with little or no other endocrinological effects. In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects. In tumor models ZK 230211 exhibited strong antiproliferative action. The pharmacological properties of ZK 230211 may prove useful in the treatment of endometriosis, leiomyomas, breast cancer, and in hormone replacement therapy., Entry 2: A novel class of nonsteroidal progesterone receptor antagonists has been synthesized and was shown to exhibit moderate binding affinity for hPR-A, the ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of human progesterone receptor (hPR) in cell-based assays, and anti-progestational activity in a murine model. Cyclocymopol monomethyl ether, a component of the marine alga Cymopolia barbata was weakly active in random screening against PR. Investigations into the SAR surrounding the core of this natural product lead structure resulted in improved in vitro activity. In contrast to the cross-reactivity profiles observed with known steroidal antiprogestins, compounds of the general structural class described display a high degree of selectivity for the progesterone receptor and no functional activity on the glucocorticoid receptor., Entry 3: A series of 6-aryl-1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinolines was synthesized and tested for functional activity on the human progesterone receptor isoform B (hPR-B) in mammalian (CV-1) cells. The lead compound LG001447 (1,2-dihydro-2,2, 4-trimethyl-6-phenylquinoline) was discovered via directed high throughput screening of a defined chemical library utilizing an hPR-B cotransfection assay. Electron-withdrawing substituents at the meta position of the C(6) aryl group afforded substantial improvements in hPR modulatory activity. Several analogues were able to potently block the effects of progesterone in vitro. Two compounds, 10 (LG120753) and 11 (LG120830) with potencies comparable or equal to the steroidal hPR antagonist onapristone (ZK98,299), were demonstrated to act as antiprogestins in vivo after oral administration to rodents. This is the first disclosure of orally active nonsteroidal antiprogestins., Entry 4: A new nonsteroidal antiandrogenic pharmacophore has been discovered using cell-based cotransfection assays with human androgen receptor (hAR). This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists.

Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.
