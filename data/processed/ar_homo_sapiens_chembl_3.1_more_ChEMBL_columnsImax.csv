Structure-activity relationship exploration on the biaryl moiety led to discovery of potent RORγt inhibitors with good oral bioavailability and CNS penetration. Compounds 9a and 9g demonstrated excellent in vivo efficacy in EAE mice dose dependently with once daily oral administration., Entry 1: A novel series of carbazole carboxamides was discovered as potent RORγt inverse agonists using a scaffold hybridization strategy. Structure-activity relationship exploration on the amide linker, carbazole ring and arylsulfone moiety of the hybrid amide 3a led to identification of potent RORγt inverse agonists. Compound 6c was found to have a good RORγt activity with an IC50 of 58.5 nM in FRET assay, and reasonable inhibitory activity in mouse Th17 cell differentiation assay (58.8% inhibition at 0.3 μM). The binding mode of carbazole carboxamides in RORγt ligand binding domain was discussed., Entry 2: GSK805 (1) is a potent RORγt inverse agonist, but a drawback of 1 is its low solubility, leading to a limited absorption in high doses. We have explored detailed structure-activity relationship on the amide linker, biaryl and arylsulfonyl moieties of 1 trying to improve solubility while maintaining RORγt activity. As a result, a novel series of carboxyl-containing biaryl urea derivatives was discovered as potent RORγt inverse agonists with improved drug-like properties. Compound 3i showed potent RORγt inhibitory activity and subtype selectivity with an IC of 63.8 nM in RORγ FRET assay and 85 nM in cell-based RORγ-GAL4 promotor reporter assay. Reasonable inhibitory activity of 3i was also achieved in mouse Th17 cell differentiation assay (76% inhibition at 0.3 μM). Moreover, 3i had greatly improved aqueous solubility at pH 7.4 compared to 1, exhibited decent mouse PK profile and demonstrated some in vivo efficacy in an imiquimod-induced psoriasis mice model., ",,CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(-c3ccccc3OC(F)(F)F)c(Cl)c2)cc1,C23H18Cl2F3NO4S,CHEMBL3609407,97.0,116.0,127.0,

A small molecule, inverse agonist of the receptor is anticipated to reduce production of IL-17, a key proinflammatory cytokine. Through a high-throughput screening approach, we identified a molecule displaying promising binding affinity for RORC2, inhibition of IL-17 production in Th17 cells, and selectivity against the related RORA and RORB receptor isoforms. Lead optimization to improve the potency and metabolic stability of this hit focused on two key design strategies, namely, iterative optimization driven by increasing lipophilic efficiency and structure-guided conformational restriction to achieve optimal ground state energetics and maximize receptor residence time.
