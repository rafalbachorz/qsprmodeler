In vitro binding studies show that 7 alpha-IDHT binds with high affinity to the rat and human androgen receptor (RBA = 74) compared to R1881 (RBA = 100). Further, this compound showed high specificity for the androgen receptor. 7 alpha-IDHT showed only a marginal affinity for the progestin receptor and even less affinity for the estrogen receptor.
