RORγt agonists increase basal activity of RORγt and could provide a potential approach to cancer immunotherapy. Herein, hit compound 1 was identified as a weak RORγt agonist during in-house library screening. Changes in LHS core of 1 led to the identification of tetrahydroquinoline compound 6 as a partial RORγt agonist (max. act. = 39.3%). Detailed structure-activity relationship on substituent of the LHS core, amide linker and RHS arylsulfonyl moiety was explored and a novel series of tetrahydroquinolines and benzomorpholines was discovered as potent RORγt agonists.
