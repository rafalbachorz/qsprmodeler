A small molecule, inverse agonist of the receptor is anticipated to reduce production of IL-17, a key proinflammatory cytokine. Through a high-throughput screening approach, we identified a molecule displaying promising binding affinity for RORC2, inhibition of IL-17 production in Th17 cells, and selectivity against the related RORA and RORB receptor isoforms. Lead optimization to improve the potency and metabolic stability of this hit focused on two key design strategies, namely, iterative optimization driven by increasing lipophilic efficiency and structure-guided conformational restriction to achieve optimal ground state energetics and maximize receptor residence time. This approach successfully identified 3-cyano- N-(3-(1-isobutyrylpiperidin-4-yl)-1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1 H-pyrrolo[2,3- b]pyridin-5-yl)benzamide as a potent and selective RORC2 inverse agonist, demonstrating good metabolic stability, oral bioavailability, and the ability to reduce IL-17 levels and skin inflammation in a preclinical in vivo animal model upon oral administration.",,CC(C)C(=O)N1CCC(c2cn(C)c3ncc(NC(=O)c4cccc(C#N)c4)c(C(F)(F)F)c23)CC1,C26H26F3N5O2,CHEMBL4278903,20.0,,,,

A variety of targets were developed for small molecule immuno-oncology agents, including retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), chemokine receptor, stimulator of interferon genes (Sting), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), toll-like receptors (TLR), etc. Among them, the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) has gradually attracted more attention in these years. In particular, LYC-55716 (cintirorgon), a small molecule RORγt agonist developed by Lycera, has entered the phase II clinical study. In this work, starting from compound 7, compound 28 was obtained after 4 rounds of compound design, synthesis and SAR studies, which had an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in dual Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (dual-FRET) assay and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in mouse Th17 cell differentiation assay. It indicated that compound 28 had excellent RORγt agonistic activity and was expected to be developed as a new type of small molecule drug for cancer immunotherapy. The molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the agonist 28 formed a strong HYF triplet intramolecular interaction to stabilize H12, which helped RORγt to form the protein-binding site and therefore made the receptor ready to recruit coactivator. When the inverse agonist s27 bound with RORγt, the steric hindrance between s27 and H479 caused the destruction of the HYF triplet, leading to the collapse of H12, thus the transcription function of RORγt was interrupted due to the failure of recruiting a coactivator molecule. The triplet HYF in RORγt and the rigidity of 28 and s27 were identified to be the structural determinants for the functional switch of RORγt.",,CC(=O)N1CCN(c2ccc3c(c2)CCN(S(=O)(=O)N(C)Cc2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc2)C3)CC1,C24H29F3N4O3S,CHEMBL4867232,25.8,,,,
