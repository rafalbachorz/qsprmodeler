Using structure activity analysis, we established that the benzimidazole moiety at C-17 is essential and optimal and also that hydrophilic and heteroaromatic groups at C-3 enhance both antiproliferative (AP) and AR degrading (ARD) activities. The most potent antiproliferative compounds were 3β-(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (47), 3-((EZ)-hydroximino)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-4,16-diene (36), and 3β-(pyridine-4-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (43), with GI50 values of 0.87, 1.91, and 2.57 μM, respectively. Compared to 5, compound 47 was 4- and 8-fold more potent with respect to AP and ARD activities, respectively.

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens.

To develop of potential anti-prostate cancer agents, 22 kinds of 4-Amino-2H-benzo[h]chromen-2-one analogs were designed and synthesized as potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist through rational drug modification leading to the discovery of a series of novel antiproliferative compounds. Analogs (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 21, 23, and 24) exhibited potent antagonistic potency against AR (inhibition >50%), and exhibited potent AR binding affinities as well as displayed the higher activities than finasteride toward LNCaP cells (AR-rich) versus PC-3 cells (AR-deficient). Moreover, the docking study suggested that the most potent antagonist 23 mainly bind to AR ligand binding pocket (LBP) site through Van der Waals' force interactions. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these designed 4-Amino-2H-benzo[h]chromen-2-one analogs was rationally explored and discussed.

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C9H9N/c1-7-6-8-4-2-3-5-9(8)10-7/h2-6,10H,1H3",0.56,-1.05,16.0,,,,,,,

The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives acetophenazine, fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics.","InChI=1S/C18H17F3N2OS/c1-2-22-10-9-17(24)23-13-5-3-4-6-15(13)25-16-8-7-12(11-14(16)23)18(19,20)21/h3-8,11,22H,2,9-10H2,1H3",0.79,-1.41,2.4,,,,,,,

Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of silicon-containing bis-phenol derivatives, with the objective of obtaining increased selectivity toward VDR or AR. We found that replacement of the quaternary carbon in the bis-phenol skeleton with silicon increased AR-antagonistic activity and reduced VDR-agonistic activity, that is, the AR selectivity of the silicon-containing compounds was higher than that of corresponding carbon compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear receptor (NR) selectivity switching by sila-substitution (C/Si exchange).

Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of silicon-containing bis-phenol derivatives, with the objective of obtaining increased selectivity toward VDR or AR. We found that replacement of the quaternary carbon in the bis-phenol skeleton with silicon increased AR-antagonistic activity and reduced VDR-agonistic activity, that is, the AR selectivity of the silicon-containing compounds was higher than that of corresponding carbon compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear receptor (NR) selectivity switching by sila-substitution (C/Si exchange).

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance.

We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens.

Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of silicon-containing bis-phenol derivatives, with the objective of obtaining increased selectivity toward VDR or AR. We found that replacement of the quaternary carbon in the bis-phenol skeleton with silicon increased AR-antagonistic activity and reduced VDR-agonistic activity, that is, the AR selectivity of the silicon-containing compounds was higher than that of corresponding carbon compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear receptor (NR) selectivity switching by sila-substitution (C/Si exchange). Among the compounds synthesized, AR-selective ligand (S,R)-3b exhibited more potent anti-androgenic activity (IC50=0.072 μM) than hydroxyflutamide, a well-known androgen antagonist (IC50=1.4 μM), in SC-3 cell proliferation assay.

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C23H30ClN3O/c1-5-27(6-2)13-7-8-16(3)25-23-19-11-9-17(24)14-22(19)26-21-12-10-18(28-4)15-20(21)23/h9-12,14-16H,5-8,13H2,1-4H3,(H,25,26)",0.45,-0.99,72.0,,,,,,,

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C24H40N8O4/c33-15-11-31(12-16-34)23-26-20-19(21(27-23)29-7-3-1-4-8-29)25-24(32(13-17-35)14-18-36)28-22(20)30-9-5-2-6-10-30/h33-36H,1-18H2",0.31,-0.52,82.0,,,,,,,

High-throughput screening is often plagued by low hit rates and many leads that are toxic or exhibit poor bioavailability. Exploiting the secondary activity of marketed drugs, on the other hand, may help in generating drug leads that can be optimized for the observed side-effect target, while maintaining acceptable bioavailability and toxicity profiles. Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico ""drug repurposing"" procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives acetophenazine, fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics.","InChI=1S/C21H26N2S2/c1-22-13-6-5-7-16(22)12-14-23-18-8-3-4-9-20(18)25-21-11-10-17(24-2)15-19(21)23/h3-4,8-11,15-16H,5-7,12-14H2,1-2H3",0.62,-1.03,2.4,,,,,,,

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C9H7NO2/c11-9(12)7-5-10-8-4-2-1-3-6(7)8/h1-5,10H,(H,11,12)",0.67,-0.10,1.0,,,,,,,

Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the structure-activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide).

Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms. Most of these drugs show limited application due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1).

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C14H10F3NO2/c15-14(16,17)9-4-3-5-10(8-9)18-12-7-2-1-6-11(12)13(19)20/h1-8,18H,(H,19,20)",0.89,-1.28,42.0,,,,,,,

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity.

High-throughput screening is often plagued by low hit rates and many leads that are toxic or exhibit poor bioavailability. Exploiting the secondary activity of marketed drugs, on the other hand, may help in generating drug leads that can be optimized for the observed side-effect target, while maintaining acceptable bioavailability and toxicity profiles. Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico ""drug repurposing"" procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives acetophenazine, fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics.","InChI=1S/C25H16F3NOS/c26-25(27,28)17-12-13-24-21(14-17)29(20-10-3-4-11-23(20)31-24)15-22(30)19-9-5-7-16-6-1-2-8-18(16)19/h1-14H,15H2",0.31,-1.26,53.0,,,,,,,

Using structure activity analysis, we established that the benzimidazole moiety at C-17 is essential and optimal and also that hydrophilic and heteroaromatic groups at C-3 enhance both antiproliferative (AP) and AR degrading (ARD) activities. The most potent antiproliferative compounds were 3β-(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (47), 3-((EZ)-hydroximino)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-4,16-diene (36), and 3β-(pyridine-4-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (43), with GI50 values of 0.87, 1.91, and 2.57 μM, respectively.

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model.

Using structure activity analysis, we established that the benzimidazole moiety at C-17 is essential and optimal and also that hydrophilic and heteroaromatic groups at C-3 enhance both antiproliferative (AP) and AR degrading (ARD) activities. The most potent antiproliferative compounds were 3β-(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (47), 3-((EZ)-hydroximino)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-4,16-diene (36), and 3β-(pyridine-4-carboxylate)-17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)androsta-5,16-diene (43), with GI50 values of 0.87, 1.91, and 2.57 μM, respectively.

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR.

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C12H12N2O/c1-7-12-10(4-5-13-7)9-3-2-8(15)6-11(9)14-12/h2-3,6,14-15H,4-5H2,1H3",0.67,1.33,162.0,,,,,,,

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model.

By taking advantage of a facile, one-pot click chemistry reaction, we report herein the preparation of a small library of novel 1,4-substituted triazoles with AR antagonistic activity. Biological and theoretical evaluation demonstrated that the introduction of the triazole core in the scaffold of nonsteroidal antiandrogens allowed the development of small molecules with improved overall AR-antagonist activity. In fact, compound 14d displayed promising in vitro antitumor activity toward three different prostate cancer cell lines and was able to induce 60% tumor growth inhibition of the CW22Rv1 in vivo xenograft model. These results represent a step toward the development of novel and improved AR antagonists.","InChI=1S/C18H10F3N5O/c19-18(20,21)17-7-15(4-3-13(17)9-23)26-10-14(24-25-26)11-27-16-5-1-12(8-22)2-6-16/h1-7,10H,11H2",0.70,-2.22,65.0,,,,,,,

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C14H11Cl2NO2/c1-8-6-7-10(15)13(12(8)16)17-11-5-3-2-4-9(11)14(18)19/h2-7,17H,1H3,(H,18,19)",0.86,-0.98,43.0,,,,,,,

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model.

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity.

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model. These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of AR antagonists.","InChI=1S/C25H29N3O6/c1-15(2)33-23-21(32-4)14-19(30)22-18(29)13-20(34-24(22)23)16-5-7-17(8-6-16)26-25(31)28-11-9-27(3)10-12-28/h5-8,13-15,30H,9-12H2,1-4H3,(H,26,31)",0.59,-0.19,75.2,,,,,,,

Among the available options, different non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonists are approved also to treat castration-resistant forms. Most of these drugs show limited application due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1).

In addition, the docking studies supported the rationalization of the biological evaluation. Among these compounds, the representative compound 48c exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on LNCaP growth and also acted as a competitive AR antagonist. Further preliminary mechanism study confirmed that 48c exerted its AR antagonistic activity through impairing AR nuclear translocation. All these results indicated that the novel scaffold compounds demonstrated AR antagonistic behavior and promising candidates for future development were identified., Entry 2: Prostate cancer (PC) is a major cause of cancer-related male death in worldwide and the identification of new and improved potent anti-PC molecules is constantly required.

Candidate compound 3f was shown to reduce AR-regulated transcription in a dose-dependent manner in nanomolar ranges and suppress expression of AR-regulated proteins Nkx3.1 and PSA in 22Rv1-ARE14 and VCaP cancer cell lines. Flexible docking study revealed similar position of 3f within AR binding site in comparison of galeterone even with stronger binding energy., Entry 4: A novel scaffold of arylpiperazine derivatives was discovered as potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist through rational drug designation based on our pre-work, leading to the discovery of a series of new antiproliferative compounds.

These results indicated that the novel scaffold compounds demonstrated a step towards the development of novel and improved AR antagonists, and promising candidates for future development were identified., Entry 5: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major cause of cancer-related male death in worldwide. To develop of potential anti-prostate cancer agents, 22 kinds of 4-Amino-2H-benzo[h]chromen-2-one analogs were designed and synthesized as potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist through rational drug modification leading to the discovery of a series of novel antiproliferative compounds. Analogs (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 21, 23, and 24) exhibited potent antagonistic potency against AR (inhibition >50%), and exhibited potent AR binding affinities as well as displayed the higher activities than finasteride toward LNCaP cells (AR-rich) versus PC-3 cells (AR-deficient). Moreover, the docking study suggested that the most potent antagonist 23 mainly bind to AR ligand binding pocket (LBP) site through Van der Waals' force interactions. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these designed 4-Amino-2H-benzo[h]chromen-2-one analogs was rationally explored and discussed. Collectively, this work provides a potential lead compound for anticancer agent development related to prostate cancer therapy, and took a step forward towards the development of novel and improved AR antagonists., Entry 6: Prostate cancer (PC) is the most diagnosed type of malignancy in men and the major frequently cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The androgen receptor (AR) has become a promising drug target for the treatment of PC. Here, we reported the design, optimization and evaluation of pyridine tetrahydroisoquinoline thiohydantoin derivatives with improved activity and safety as potent AR antagonists. The most promising compound 42f exhibited potent inhibitory activity on AR and strongly blocked AR nuclear translocation. Moreover, 42f displayed promising in vitro antitumor activity toward AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP) and also demonstrated therapeutic effects in LNCaP xenograft tumor model in mice (TGI: 79%) with no apparent toxicity observed in vivo. More importantly, 42f showed negligible penetration of the brain-blood barrier (BBB) compared with enzalutamide. These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of androgen receptor antagonists for potential therapeutics against PC with lower seizurogenic risk for patients., Entry 7: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies affecting men worldwide. Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model.

Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of silicon-containing bis-phenol derivatives, with the objective of obtaining increased selectivity toward VDR or AR. We found that replacement of the quaternary carbon in the bis-phenol skeleton with silicon increased AR-antagonistic activity and reduced VDR-agonistic activity, that is, the AR selectivity of the silicon-containing compounds was higher than that of corresponding carbon compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear receptor (NR) selectivity switching by sila-substitution (C/Si exchange).

Prolonged LBP-targeting leads to resistance, and alternative therapies are urgently required. We report the identification and characterization of a novel series of diarylhydrazides as selective disruptors of AR interaction with coactivators through application of structure and ligand-based virtual screening. Compounds demonstrate full (""true"") antagonism in AR with low micromolar potency, selectivity over estrogen receptors α and β and glucocorticoid receptor, and partial antagonism of the progesterone receptor. MDG506 (5) demonstrates low cellular toxicity in PCa models and dose responsive reduction of classical antiandrogen-induced prostate specific antigen expression. These data provide compelling evidence for such non-LBP intervention as an alternative approach or in combination with classical PCa therapy.","InChI=1S/C18H13BrN2O3/c19-14-5-6-16(22)13(7-14)10-20-21-18(24)15-8-11-3-1-2-4-12(11)9-17(15)23/h1-10,22-23H,(H,21,24)/b20-10+",0.47,-1.10,0.0,,,,,,,

However, the overexpression of glucocorticoids receptor (GR) in mCRPC cells causes the resistance of antiandrogen and leads to the failure of androgen receptor (AR) targeting therapy. Herein, based on the chemical structures of antiandrogen and crystal structure of GR, we set up to develop GR/AR (GR and AR) dual antagonist by virtual screening and biological evaluation. We identified Z19 as a dual AR/GR antagonist. Z19 inhibited the transcription activity of both AR and GR, reducing both protein and mRNA level of the downstream proteins of GR and AR signaling, and provided a potential lead compound for the development of novel treatment agents of prostate cancer.

We have proposed that inhibitors, which bind to nuclear receptor surfaces that mediate assembly of the receptor's binding partners, might overcome some of these limitations. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, but conventional inhibitors lose effectiveness as cancer treatments because anti-androgen resistance usually develops. We conducted functional and x-ray screens to identify compounds that bind the AR surface and block binding of coactivators for AR activation function 2 (AF-2). Four compounds that block coactivator binding in solution with IC(50) approximately 50 microM and inhibit AF-2 activity in cells were detected: three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid. Although visualization of compounds at the AR surface reveals weak binding at AF-2, the most potent inhibitors bind preferentially to a previously unknown regulatory surface cleft termed binding function (BF)-3, which is a known target for mutations in prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome. X-ray structural analysis reveals that 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid binding to BF-3 remodels the adjacent interaction site AF-2 to weaken coactivator binding. Mutation of residues that form BF-3 inhibits AR function and AR AF-2 activity. We propose that BF-3 is a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site needed for AR activity in vivo and a possible pharmaceutical target.","InChI=1S/C14H12ClNO2/c1-9-11(15)6-4-8-12(9)16-13-7-3-2-5-10(13)14(17)18/h2-8,16H,1H3,(H,17,18)",0.87,-1.04,47.0,,,,,,,

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR. Notably, 10e efficiently inhibited the growth of ARv7 dependent prostate cancer cell-lines, which are completely resistant to all current anti-androgens. Compound 10e also showed strong antitumor activity in the LNCaP (androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line) in vivo xenograft model. These results provide a foundation for the development of a new class of AR antagonists.","InChI=1S/C20H21NO7S/c1-11(2)27-19-17(26-3)10-15(23)18-14(22)9-16(28-20(18)19)12-5-7-13(8-6-12)21-29(4,24)25/h5-11,21,23H,1-4H3",0.63,0.18,71.4,,,,,,,
