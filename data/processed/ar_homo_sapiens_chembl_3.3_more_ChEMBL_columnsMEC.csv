Because they are activated by a variety of hormonal molecules, including retinoic acid, vitamin D, and steroid hormones, they are assumed to be promising targets for clinical drugs. We previously found that one ascochlorin (1) derivative, 4-O-carboxymethyl-ascochlorin (2), is a potent agonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Here, we synthesized derivatives of 1, designated as a lead compound, to create new modulators of nuclear hormone receptors. Two derivatives, 4-O-carboxymethyl-2-O-methylascochlorin (9) and 4-O-isonicotinoyl-2-O-methylascochlorin (10), showed improved agonistic activity for PPARgamma and induced differentiation of a progenitor cell line, C3H10T1/2. We also found that 1, dehydroascofuranon (29), and a 2,4-O-diacetyl-1-carboxylic acid derivative of 1 (5) specifically activated estrogen receptors, PPARalpha, and an androgen receptor. All of the derivatives (1-29) activated the pregnane X receptor. These results suggest that the chemical structure of 1 is useful in designing novel modulators of nuclear receptors.","InChI=1S/C27H33ClO7/c1-14(12-13-27(7)15(2)9-11-21(31)17(27)4)8-10-20-24(34-18(5)29)22(26(32)33)16(3)23(28)25(20)35-19(6)30/h8,12-13,15,17H,9-11H2,1-7H3,(H,32,33)/b13-12+,14-8+/t15-,17+,27+/m1/s1",0.28,1.64,1.0
