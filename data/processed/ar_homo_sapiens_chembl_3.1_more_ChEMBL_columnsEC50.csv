These results also encourage the development of small molecule immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy. RORγt is a key transcription factor mediating Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 production, which is able to activate CD8+ T cells and elicit antitumor efficacy. Since RORγt agonists have been shown to increase basal activity of RORγt and promote Th17 cell differentiation, development of RORγt agonists could provide a unique approach to cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize RORγt sterol and synthetic agonists, analyze the common ground of their mode of actions, and discuss the potential role of RORγt agonists as small molecule therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy., Entry 1: The nuclear receptor RORγt is a key positive regulator in the differentiation and proliferation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-17a. Dysregulation of this pathway can result in the development of various autoimmune diseases, and inhibition of RORγt with small molecules thus holds great potential as a therapeutic strategy. RORγt has a unique allosteric ligand binding site in the ligand binding domain, which is distinct from the canonical, orthosteric binding site. Allosteric modulation of RORγt shows high potential, but the targeted discovery of novel allosteric ligands is highly challenging via currently available methods. Here, we introduce covalent, orthosteric chemical probes for RORγt that occlude the binding of canonical, orthosteric ligands but still allow allosteric ligand binding. Ultimately, these probes could be used to underpin screening approaches for the unambiguous and rapid identification of novel allosteric RORγt ligands., ",,CC(C)=CCC[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CC=C4C[C@@H](O)CC[C@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@@]21C,C27H44O,CHEMBL455876,48.0,80.0,,,,,

SAR studies on the core structures, the RHS hydrophilic side chains and the LHS hydrophobic aryl groups of a hybrid compound 3 led to the identification of potent RORγt agonists with improved drug-like properties.

Present studies indicate that 14 deserves further investigation in tumor animal models as a potential candidate of RORγt agonist for cancer immunotherapy., Entry 2: Cancer immunotherapy has become a research hotspot in recent years. A variety of targets were developed for small molecule immuno-oncology agents, including retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), chemokine receptor, stimulator of interferon genes (Sting), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), toll-like receptors (TLR), etc. Among them, the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) has gradually attracted more attention in these years. In particular, LYC-55716 (cintirorgon), a small molecule RORγt agonist developed by Lycera, has entered the phase II clinical study. In this work, starting from compound 7, compound 28 was obtained after 4 rounds of compound design, synthesis and SAR studies, which had an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in dual Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (dual-FRET) assay and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in mouse Th17 cell differentiation assay. It indicated that compound 28 had excellent RORγt agonistic activity and was expected to be developed as a new type of small molecule drug for cancer immunotherapy. The molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the agonist 28 formed a strong HYF triplet intramolecular interaction to stabilize H12, which helped RORγt to form the protein-binding site and therefore made the receptor ready to recruit coactivator. When the inverse agonist s27 bound with RORγt, the steric hindrance between s27 and H479 caused the destruction of the HYF triplet, leading to the collapse of H12, thus the transcription function of RORγt was interrupted due to the failure of recruiting a coactivator molecule. The triplet HYF in RORγt and the rigidity of 28 and s27 were identified to be the structural determinants for the functional switch of RORγt., Entry 3: Cancer immunotherapy has become a research hotspot in recent years.

Despite diverse chemical series having been reported, combining high potency and nuclear receptor selectivity with good physicochemical properties remains a challenging endeavor in the field of RORγt drug discovery. We recently described the discovery and evaluation of a new class of potent and selective RORγt inverse agonists based on a thiazole scaffold. Herein we describe the successful optimization of this class by incorporation of an additional amide moiety at the 4-position of the thiazole core. In several optimization cycles, we have reduced human PXR activation, improved solubility, and increased potency while maintaining nuclear receptor selectivity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound 1g bound in the sterol binding site of the ligand binding domain of RORγt was largely consistent with an earlier structure, guiding further insight into the molecular mechanism for RORγt inhibition with this series.

A variety of targets were developed for small molecule immuno-oncology agents, including retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), chemokine receptor, stimulator of interferon genes (Sting), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), toll-like receptors (TLR), etc. Among them, the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) has gradually attracted more attention in these years.

When the inverse agonist s27 bound with RORγt, the steric hindrance between s27 and H479 caused the destruction of the HYF triplet, leading to the collapse of H12, thus the transcription function of RORγt was interrupted due to the failure of recruiting a coactivator molecule.

A variety of targets were developed for small molecule immuno-oncology agents, including retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), chemokine receptor, stimulator of interferon genes (Sting), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), toll-like receptors (TLR), etc. Among them, the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) has gradually attracted more attention in these years. In particular, LYC-55716 (cintirorgon), a small molecule RORγt agonist developed by Lycera, has entered the phase II clinical study. In this work, starting from compound 7, compound 28 was obtained after 4 rounds of compound design, synthesis and SAR studies, which had an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in dual Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (dual-FRET) assay and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in mouse Th17 cell differentiation assay. It indicated that compound 28 had excellent RORγt agonistic activity and was expected to be developed as a new type of small molecule drug for cancer immunotherapy. The molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the agonist 28 formed a strong HYF triplet intramolecular interaction to stabilize H12, which helped RORγt to form the protein-binding site and therefore made the receptor ready to recruit coactivator. When the inverse agonist s27 bound with RORγt, the steric hindrance between s27 and H479 caused the destruction of the HYF triplet, leading to the collapse of H12, thus the transcription function of RORγt was interrupted due to the failure of recruiting a coactivator molecule. The triplet HYF in RORγt and the rigidity of 28 and s27 were identified to be the structural determinants for the functional switch of RORγt.",,CC(=O)N1CCN(c2ccc3c(c2)CCN(S(=O)(=O)N(C)Cc2ccc(F)cc2)C3)CC1,C23H29FN4O3S,CHEMBL4859480,1020.0,,,,,,

A variety of targets were developed for small molecule immuno-oncology agents, including retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), chemokine receptor, stimulator of interferon genes (Sting), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), toll-like receptors (TLR), etc. Among them, the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) has gradually attracted more attention in these years. In particular, LYC-55716 (cintirorgon), a small molecule RORγt agonist developed by Lycera, has entered the phase II clinical study. In this work, starting from compound 7, compound 28 was obtained after 4 rounds of compound design, synthesis and SAR studies, which had an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in dual Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (dual-FRET) assay and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.021 ± 0.002 μM in mouse Th17 cell differentiation assay. It indicated that compound 28 had excellent RORγt agonistic activity and was expected to be developed as a new type of small molecule drug for cancer immunotherapy. The molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the agonist 28 formed a strong HYF triplet intramolecular interaction to stabilize H12, which helped RORγt to form the protein-binding site and therefore made the receptor ready to recruit coactivator. When the inverse agonist s27 bound with RORγt, the steric hindrance between s27 and H479 caused the destruction of the HYF triplet, leading to the collapse of H12, thus the transcription function of RORγt was interrupted due to the failure of recruiting a coactivator molecule. The triplet HYF in RORγt and the rigidity of 28 and s27 were identified to be the structural determinants for the functional switch of RORγt.",,CC(=O)N1CCN(c2ccc3c(c2)CCN(S(=O)(=O)N(C)CCc2ccccc2)C3)CC1,C24H32N4O3S,CHEMBL4864723,2230.0,,,,,,
