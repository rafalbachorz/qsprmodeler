Accordingly, AR-targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of related human diseases and conditions. AR agonists are an important class of drugs in the treatment of bone loss and muscle atrophy. AR antagonists have also been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, selective AR degraders (SARDs) have been reported. More recently, heterobifunctional degrader molecules of AR have been developed, and four such compounds are now in clinical development for the treatment of human prostate cancer. This review attempts to summarize the different types of compounds designed to target AR and the current frontiers of research on this important therapeutic target., ",,Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1N1CCN(C(=O)[C@@H]2C[C@@H]2c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1,C21H22ClFN2O,CHEMBL4564335,1700.0,15200.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6750.0,1700.0,8450.0,8450.0,15200.0,3.926856709,3.926856709,3.230448921,5.073143291,5.073143291,5.769551079,2,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,8450.0,8450.0,1700.0,15200.0,5.073143291050307,5.073143291050307,5.769551078621726,4.818156412055227,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,INACTIVE,INACTIVE,ACTIVE,EC50

In continuation of our program to identify and develop improved efficacious novel small-molecule agents designed to disrupt AR signaling through enhanced AR degradation, we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated novel C-3 modified analogues of our phase 3 clinical agent, galeterone (5). Concerns of potential in vivo stability of our recently discovered more efficacious galeterone 3β-imidazole carbamate (6) led to the design and synthesis of new steroidal compounds. Two of the 11 compounds, 3β-pyridyl ether (8) and 3β-imidazole (17) with antiproliferative GI50 values of 3.24 and 2.54 μM against CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cell, are 2.75- and 3.5-fold superior to 5.
