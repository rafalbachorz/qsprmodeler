Identification of starting points for RORγt inverse agonists with good properties has been a challenge. We report the identification of a fragment hit and its conversion into a potent inverse agonist through fragment optimization, growing and merging efforts. Further analysis of the binding mode revealed that inverse agonism was achieved by an unusual mechanism. In contrast to other reported inverse agonists, there is no direct interaction or displacement of helix 12 observed in the crystal structure.
