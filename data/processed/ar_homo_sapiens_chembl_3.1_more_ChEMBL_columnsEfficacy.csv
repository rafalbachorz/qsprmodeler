Tertiary sulfonamide 1 was found to be a potent RORγt inverse agonist previously. However, the high hepatic clearance value limits its druggability. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of N-sulfonamide-tetrahydroquinolines by molecular modeling and scaffold hopping strategy, aiming at improving the metabolic stabilities. Detailed SAR exploration led to identification of potent RORγt inverse agonists such as 13 with moderate binding affinity and inhibitory activity of Th17 cell differentiation. Binding mode of 13 with RORγt-LBD was revealed by molecular docking. Moreover, 13 showed lower intrinsic clearance in mouse liver microsomes compared with 1 and potent in vivo efficacy and safety in psoriasis models, which can be used as a good starting point for the further optimization., ",,CC(=O)N1CCN(c2ccc(CN(C3CCC3)S(=O)(=O)Cc3ccccc3)cc2)CC1,C24H31N3O3S,CHEMBL3317836,-106.3,97.0,,

RORγt lies at the core of this pathway and represents an attractive opportunity for intervention with small molecule therapeutics. Despite diverse chemical series having been reported, combining high potency and nuclear receptor selectivity with good physicochemical properties remains a challenging endeavor in the field of RORγt drug discovery. We recently described the discovery and evaluation of a new class of potent and selective RORγt inverse agonists based on a thiazole scaffold. Herein we describe the successful optimization of this class by incorporation of an additional amide moiety at the 4-position of the thiazole core. In several optimization cycles, we have reduced human PXR activation, improved solubility, and increased potency while maintaining nuclear receptor selectivity.

In several optimization cycles, we have reduced human PXR activation, improved solubility, and increased potency while maintaining nuclear receptor selectivity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound 1g bound in the sterol binding site of the ligand binding domain of RORγt was largely consistent with an earlier structure, guiding further insight into the molecular mechanism for RORγt inhibition with this series.

In several optimization cycles, we have reduced human PXR activation, improved solubility, and increased potency while maintaining nuclear receptor selectivity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound 1g bound in the sterol binding site of the ligand binding domain of RORγt was largely consistent with an earlier structure, guiding further insight into the molecular mechanism for RORγt inhibition with this series. Compound 1g is orally bioavailable, potent in a human whole blood assay and proved to be efficacious in an ex-vivo IL-17A assay, and was selected for preclinical evaluation., Entry 1: The nuclear receptor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) is a transcription factor that drives Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 production in both innate and adaptive immune cells.
